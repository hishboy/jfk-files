OCCURRENCE:
Lansdale also suggests other activities to carry out objective C (i.e. intensification

These include the spotting, recruiting and training of travelers who have potential access to significant information, maintaining Pan American Airlines service between the U.S. and Cuba, expanding as practical communications intelligence coverage of Cuban communications networks, the continuing monitoring of overt Cuban broadcasts, etc.

OCCURRENCE:
"Pursuant to our telephone conversation this afternoon, it would seem worthwhile

PERSONS/ENTITIES:
Helms, Richard

DATES:
1962

CATEGORIES:
Castro
Mongoose

OCCURRENCE:
Helms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way," and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recall having been told by
anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The
above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense.". The pressure led to several
"very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pigs
and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1962. The Cuban Missile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. Afterwards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving
'economic warfare' such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries
including an attempt to stop the sale by the Leyland Bus Company in Spain of buses.

KIRKPATRICK

OCCURRENCE:
With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandum.
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA and AMORID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which
SOURCE: would logically have led to the discussions at the time STAFF:
of the Matahambre operation."

MONGOOSE

OCCURRENCE:
Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE'S
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disastrous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
the U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper.
He mentioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures through the introduction of biological agents which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could
be completely covered up.

OCCURRENCE:
When RFK asked Helms for his comments, Helms stated that "we were prepared
to get on with the new action program and that we would execute it aggressively."
Helms pointed out, however, that the objective of Operation MONGOOSE would have to be
determined at some point since the Cubans with whom we have to work were seeking a
reason for risking their lives in these operations. Helms detailed his conversation
with the young Cuban from the DRE who pointed out that they were willing to
commit people only on operations which they regarded as sensible. Helms defines
sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberation
of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction
with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point
was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.

that any action would embarrass the negotiations, which was why he was asking.
