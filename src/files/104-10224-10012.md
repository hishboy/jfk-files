MEMORANDUM FOR: Lee H. Wigren

VIA: Head of Career Service

FROM: B. DeFelice
Acting Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their
eventual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to
inform each employee, well in advance of retirement, of the services
the Agency provides for retirement planning.

2. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought
and careful planning so that you may make the transition to
the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To as-
sist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the future, be invited by a Retirement Counselor to
an individual pre-retirement counseling session, or more than
one if you wish. This phase of retirement planning will be
tailored solely to your own particular situation and circum-
stances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information
on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor bene-
fits, life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, and
assistance in obtaining other employment. In addition, you
will be referred to attend a Retirement Information Seminar
that will be offered in the autumn of 1973.

3. Experience has amply demonstrated that advance
preparation eases the transition to retirement. I recom-
mend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the
Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: John P. O'Reilly

FROM : William E. Nelson
Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT : Letter of Commendation

We have just completed a high level, sensitive
conference of considerable importance to both this
Directorate and the Agency. You had the responsi-
bility for virtually every aspect of its organization
and administration. The planning and execution had
to be done with comprehensive attention to detail
without losing sight of our overall objectives. For
weeks in advance and, particularly, during the
conference itself you carried out your duties with
energy, skill and competence which have reflected
very creditably upon the Agency. You showed consid-
erable tact and alertness in anticipating problems
before they could arise. The close and cooperative
relationship you established with the command and
support personnel at the meeting site, and your
obvious rapport with our various guests, also
contributed to the efficient yet cordial environment
in which the conference was conducted. You faced
demanding and often complex responsibilities, and I
commend you for your excellent performance in meeting
them.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDO Evaluation Boards

FROM : Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

SUBJECT: Promotion Recommendation for Lee H. Wigren

1. I recommend that Lee H. Wigren be promoted from GS-13
to GS-14. Mr. Wigren has been in grade since May 1962 and is
now a GS-13, Step 8. He currently occupies a GS-15, Operations
Officer, Branch Chief position.

2. Mr. Wigren was born 1 December 1923. He received a
BA degree in Russian Studies from Yale University in 1947 and
an MA degree in History from Harvard University in 1950. He
entered on duty with CIA as a GS-06 clerk in March 1951. He
subsequently attained professional status as an Intelligence
Officer in 1952 and since that time has served variously as
Intelligence Officer, Area Operations Officer, Biographics
Officer, Instructor, and Operations Officer in DIV/D, Europe
Division, SE Division, OTR, and since 1968 the Counterintelli-
gence Staff.

3. Most of Mr. Wigren's career has involved CE and CI
matters. He has been primarily concerned with various aspects
of the Counterintelligence research and analysis activity of
SE Division and, since 1968, the Counterintelligence Staff.
In the course of his various assignments, he has developed a
broad and deep substantive knowledge of the Soviet intelli-
gence and security organs and their activities which has made
him one of our more knowledgeable and effective CI analysts.
He is careful and thorough in his research, he writes well,
and he has an established reputation within and without CIA
as an interesting and effective lecturer concerning counter-
intelligence matters. His career record reflects a consistently
professional performance of above-average quality in his vari-
ous CIA assignments. Additionally, that record is documented
by several letters of appreciation from other US Government
agencies and foreign liaison services for the highly profes-
sional assistance provided them by Mr. Wigren in the counter-
intelligence field.

--- Page 7 ---

2.
4. Mr. Wigren is currently Chief of the External
Research Branch of the CI Research and Analysis Group. He
is performing the duties and responsibilities of this GS-15
position in a satisfactory manner. He manages the complex
activities of six staff officers and nine contract person-
nel associated with this Branch and is responsible for the
several research programs in which they are involved. He
strives to direct and combine the best talents of the person-
nel under his supervision toward the achievement of his
Branch's objectives while remaining sensitive to the personal
and career interests of his employees. He is especially effec-
tive in dealing with the several contract personnel (including
former defectors) under his supervision who, because of their
professional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, some-
times require especially understanding treatment.
5. In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satis-
factorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a
position which requires specialized substantive knowledge
and the ability to manage activities and supervise person-
nel. I believe that his demonstrated ability in this posi-
tion and his sustained record of job performance at an above-
average level since his last promotion clearly merit his
promotion to GS-14 at this time.

Dear Mr. Nelson:
25 FEB 1974
(C) It is a distinct pleasure for me to express my sincere appreciation
to Messrs. Raymond Rocca, William Decker, William Donnelly, John Bogart,
Joseph Flaherty, Lee Wigren, Robert Thomas and Paul Johnson, all members
of your staff, for their outstanding participation and support of our
new "Soviet Intelligence Elective Seminar." This seminar provided an
in-depth examination of the Soviet Intelligence and Security Services
for twelve graduate degree candidates enrolled in the School's new Masters
Degree Program in Strategic Intelligence.
(U) Each Agency participant displayed a thorough knowledge of the subject
interlaced with personal experiences and analyses which made each presen-
tation unique and extremely valuable for the seminar members. In addition
to the participants' formal presentations, they also spent valuable time
informally talking with individual members of the seminar and faculty,
Our students and faculty were enthusiastic in their praise of all aspects
for the program; and they especially appreciated the candid discussions of
the problems Soviet intelligence poses both for the Agency and the Intel-
ligence Community. Please convey to each participant our sincere thanks
for his outstanding presentation and his interest in the School's Graduate
Program.
(U) Your continued cooperation in assisting this School to educate students
whose intelligence capabilities will be an asset to the Services and
Intelligence Community is deeply appreciated.
Sincerely,
W. J. FORNAS

South African Police Headquarters,
Private Bag 94,
Pretoria.
17th March, 1967.
Mr. R. Helms,
Central Intelligence Agency,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Helms,
During a recent conversation with one of my officers in connection with the
visit of Mr. Henry Planke and Mr. Lee Wigren, it suddenly dawned on me that although
I had, at the time, requested both Mr. John Mertz and Messrs. Planke and Wigren to
convey my sincere thanks and good wishes to you which I am sure they did - I had not
yet written to you personally in connection with the matter.
Hank and Lee, as we affectionately remember them, proved themselves to bo
most worthy ambassadors of your country, as well as your service and I feel convinced
that they left behind them a number of sincere new friends. They are both obviously
experienced officers with a wide and thorough knowledge of their respective fields and
we found their lectures highly instructive.
Fortunately, circumstances permitted the majority of my senior officers to
attend the course in Pretoria and the lucid manner in which Hank and Lee delivered their
lectures, brought us all under a new and deeper awareness of the vital role being played
by the United States in the struggle against international communism, and for the very
great need of unity and closer co-operation amongst the peoples of the free world if the
communist onslaught is to be successfully withstood.
Please once again accept my sincere thanks for having made two such able
and experienced officers as Hank and Leo available for the purpose of lecturing to us.
Kindest regards,
Sincerely,
H.J. VANDEN BERGH,
Major-General.

IN REPLY REFER TO:
Mr. John H. Richardson
Director of Training
Central Intelligence Agency

Dear Mr. Richardson:
It is a pleasure to express the appreciation of the
Staff and Faculty of the U. S. Army Intelligence School
for the presentation by Mr. Lee A. Wigren, at Fort Holabird,
on 8 March 1967, to personnel attending Class 67-SO-2 of the
Senior Foreign Officer Intelligence Course.
Mr. Wigren's discussion of current trends in Soviet
foreign policy was factual and timely. His examples of
Soviet activity in the foreign policy sphere in Vietnam,
the Middle East and Africa were of definite value to this
class. The talk was highly interesting and was enthusiastic-
ally received.
Thank you for your continued cooperation in our guest
speaker program. Would you please convey to Mr. Wigren
the appreciation of the Staff and Faculty.
Sincerely,
RICHARD S. SMITH

:
Head of Career Service
SUBJECT
Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
8 August 1966
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation.
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
My
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made with-
in 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services Career Service Board,
Secretary
SUBJECT : Promotion Recommendation for Mr. Lee H. Wigren

1. In recommending most strongly Mr. Wigren's promotion
from GS-12 to GS-13, I feel it is only necessary to emphasize
Mr. Wigren's educational background at Yale and Harvard, where
he received a B.A. and M.A. in History and Russian; his ten
years of work in the Agency on Soviet intelligence in the CI
Staff, FI/D, and SR Division; his ability during the past three
years in SR to supervise a group of over twelve people performing
a variety of research functions, ranging from major studios to
operational aids, on the RIS; his appreciation of the counter-
intelligence role of the Agency and his furtherance of our
mission in that respect by the high standards of excellence of
his production; and his vigor in assuming and carrying out the
duties of a job formerly held by a GS-15.

2. Mr. Wigren has been in grade for almost four years.
He has had responsibilities and performed duties far above his
grade level for three of those years while dealing with practically
all of the DD/P, other agencies of the government, and foreign
intelligence and security services. He is an acknowledged expert
in his field and equalled in it by no one olse in the Agency, and
possibly in the government as a whole. His fitness reports have
reflected superior performance in every important respect and out-
standing performance in many ways, with the highest personal char-
acteristics possible, doing a job on a uniquely difficult subject,
while using and training personnel who all too often have had
little or no background for their positions.

3. In my opinion, Mr. Wigren is
