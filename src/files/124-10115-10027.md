THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON
THE ASSASSINATION OF
PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Enclosed for the Bureau is one copy of a self-explanatory Paris Embassy CAS (Controlled American Source - [S]) CIA memorandum along with a copy of the letter in Spanish mentioned in the memorandum.

The Paris Office has referred this matter to the High General Staff (HGS), Madrid, Spain, with a request for investigation by that service in an effort to locate and identify the sender of the letter, and to interview him for any data he may be able to supply. The results of this Paris request of the HGS will be promptly reported when available.
