TYPIC/QUIMF/Unidentified Cuban in Zaragoza
SUBJECT
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Osvaldo GARCIA who arrived in Spain nearly two
months ago to supervise the production of two-burner stoves
being manufactured by the Spanish firm Tallers Cataluna, S.A.
(TACA) (TACA is also manufacturing the 10,000 cane wagons for
the Cubans), passed through Madrid on 23 September and told
AMAUTO-1 that there was an unidentified Cuban in Zaragoza
who is preparing a study on Spanish firms trading with Cuba.
AMAUTO-1 immediately suspected that this Cuban was an agent
of RVROCK and suggested that GARCIA get to know this person
and try to elicit biographic information as well as attempt
to get a photograph of him for possible identification.

2. Station has no idea who this Cuban might be.

As explained in Reference we are forwarding several

We would appreciate KIAMBROSIA reviewing the photographs
to possibly identify the official she met in Madrid.

Photograph #1 - Guillermo RUIZ Perez, Cuban Minister
Photograph #2 - Aristides DIAZ Rovirosa, First
Secretary and current Intelligence
officer.
Photograph #3 - Orestes BARREDA Perez; First Secretary
Photograph #4 - Jose DIAZ Puga, Attache and suspected

OF HOW LONG SHE WAS IN CONTACT WITH FJSTEALER. SHE MAY
NOT REVEAL PITCH BECAUSE BY SO DOING SHE WOULD BE CUTTING
OWN THROAT AND THIS WOULD MAKE HER SUBJECT TO SEVERE
SCRUTINY AND INTERROGATION. ON OTHER HAND IF SHE REVEALS
PITCH THIS MIGHT SERVE AMP
