TESTIMONY OF ROBERT G. HALLEY
ACCOMPANIED BY JOHN RIGALL AND SEYMOUR R. BOLTEN

Mr. Halley: My name is Robert G. Halley.

Mr. Johnston: And I understand that is an alias and your true identity will be preserved by the Agency.

Mr. Halley: That is correct.

Mr. Johnston: Mr. Bolten, would you state your full name?

Mr. Bolten: Seymour Bolten, Seymour R. Bolten.

Mr. Johnston: And John, the alias you are testifying under?

Mr. Rigall: John Rigall, R-i-g-a-l-l.

Mr. Johnston: And Mr. Bolten and Mr. Rigall, would you state your capacity in this session today?

Mr. Bolten: I am chief of the Review Staff of the CIA and responsible for dealings with the Senate Select Committee.

Mr. Rigall: I am Special Assistant to the DCI, sitting in here as an alternate monitor.

Mr. Johnston: And the discussion that has taken place prior to going on the record today basically has resulted in a decision to have Mr. Bolten and Mr. Rigall attend as monitors to this session, and do you understand that, Mr. Halley?

Mr. Halley: Yes, I do.

Mr. Johnston: Mr. Halley, what was your capacity with the Agency in November, 1963?

Mr. Halley: In November, 1963, I was the Chief of Station of the CIA operation that was based in Miami, Florida, targeted as its primarily responsibility for the Cuban operation.

Mr. Johnston: Mr. Wallach has reminded me to remind you of a procedural matter which, you understand you have the right to counsel.

Mr. Halley: Yes, I do.

Mr. Johnston: And you understand you have a right not to answer questions if you don't wish to, or not to answer questions until you consult with Counsel, is that correct?

Mr. Halley: That is correct.

Mr. Johnston: And you are appearing here voluntarily without counsel.

Mr. Halley: That is correct.

Mr. Johnston: And going back to substantive questions, how long did you remain as Chief of Station? What were the dates of your service?

Mr. Halley: Well, I arrived, or became involved in the Cuban operations in the early 1962, and I stayed there until approximately June of 1965.

Senator Schweiker: What month again in '62?

Mr. Halley: Early '62. I didn't give you the month, Senator, because I originally came down to Florida to conduct a survey of this operation to see what possibilities could be carried out in terms of the collection of intelligence. Later I filed a report on it, and I was later assigned down there.

Senator Schweiker: And this was called JMWAVE, was it?

Mr. Halley: That is the cryptonym that the Agency used for the Miami station.

Senator Schweiker: And to whom in that chain of command at the CIA did you report when you were the operating head?

Mr. Halley: There were different people at different times. When I first went to Miami, the task force commander was Mr. William Harvey. He reported then to the DDP, who reported to the Director of Central Intelligence. At a later point in the operation, Mr. Harvey moved on to other tasks, and Mr. Fitzgerald became the chief of that particular unit, and then after Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Hart was the head of that particular unit. And between Harvey and Fitzgerald, I think there was a short period of time when a fellow by the name of Bruce Cheever was the acting chief of that particular unit, or the chief. I have forgotten the exact arrangement there.

Senator Schweiker: Sometime during this period, did it change its title from Task Force W to SAS, is that correct or not correct, or do I have it mixed up?

Mr. Halley: My recollection of that chronology was that it was first called SAS and then became Task Force W, and then became integrated back into Division, which was the West Hemisphere Division.

Senator Schweiker: SAS preceded Task Force W?

TOP SECRET

Mr. Halley: Yes. That's off the top of my head, that's my recollection of it.

Mr. Johnston: Just for the record, I think it was the other way around, Task Force W was first and SAS was second.

Senator Schweiker: But in sum and substance your duties were basically the same, whether it was Task Force W or SAS, under Harvey and Fitzgerald, was that not true?

Mr. Halley: Well, I think you have to break this period up into two phases, Senator. The early phase, 1962, was focused on coming up with an appraisal of what kind of an operation could be ran against Cuba in the context which is at that time, in other words, after the Bay of Pigs, after the post mortems had been conducted. The Administration at the time decided that they wanted to take another look at Cuba as an intelligence and national security problem. Therefore, an assessment was to be made in the early period of time as to what kind of an operation could be run in pursuit of U.S. policy objectives, which was to see if Fidel Castro's regime could be removed. And when that assessment was conducted as to what kind of intelligence operations could be conducted, what kind of paramilitary or other operations could be run, that was an initial phase, and that phase was approved, and put into effect, but as that operation was being put into effect the missile crisis came on us, so that that was never really carried to its logical conclusion because the operation then shifted.

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

Senator Schweiker: After October of '62?

Mr. Halley: No, prior to October of '62, because the Cuban crisis was in October of '62, but the buildup preceded it, and our operations which were collecting intelligence in Cuba detected this buildup as it was unfolding. Therefore, the national priority became now how do you take action against Fidel Castro, but what is the nature of this Soviet buildup. And therefore the operation changed.

Then after the Cuban missile crisis of October of 1962, the problem became one of monitoring the Soviet disengagement from Cuba, and then there was another phase after that where the Soviets were out, Castro was clearly recognized as the established power in Cuba, and the problem became one of looking at Cuba in the context of was there some other way to get a political change in Cuba other than by military action or by paramilitary action. In other words, the emphasis shifted to looking at the Castro military establishment to see if a coup could be pulled from within, to see if economic pressures could be put on the Castro regime.

So the tasking of this particular unit did change, and change of nuances and degrees during this period, but in a professional sense it was focused on the Cuban targets. So in that sense you are correct, but it did go through various changes as events changed.

Senator Schweiker: What was the relationship of your station and your assignment to General Lansdale? What role did he play?

Mr. Halley: Well, in the early days, in the early period of 1962, General Lansdale was a member of a group that was looking at the basic problem of what could be done against the Cuban activity. This came up in one of my previous conversations with Mr. Baron.

Senator Schweiker: Are you talking about something we call Operation MONGOOSE, are we talking about Special Group Augmented, or what are we talking about?

Mr. Halley: Well, when I first came into this activity in 1962, the principal people that seemed to be involved with it at that time were Robert Kennedy, General Lansdale, Dick Helms, and William Harvey, and the group of Kennedy, Lansdale and Helms were providing, if you will, the guidance and the direction as to where this thing should go in the early days. Shortly after the operation was established and I was in Miami, Lansdale seems to have faded out of this particular picture, and I was not involved in the Washington nuances of this, so I am not clear as to exactly what was the reason for his departure from this particular scene.

Senator Schweiker: And was that - do you remember the cryptonym Operation MONGOOSE?

Mr. Halley: I've heard the cryptonym Operation MONGOOSE, but that didn't impact on my life at that particular time.

Senator Schweiker: All right.

Mr. Johnston: Moving to the time of the Kennedy assassination, were you Chief of Station and in Miami when the President was assassinated?

Mr. Halley: Yes, I was the Chief of Station and I was in Miami.

Mr. Johnston: You were physically in Miami on November 22nd?

Mr. Halley: Yes, I was.

Mr. Johnston: Did you receive any orders through CIA channels to conduct an investigation in any fashion into the assassination of the President?

Mr. Halley: Well, my recollection of that was that we had requests for name traces at the time that Oswald was arrested, and that was our contribution to the investigation.

Mr. Johnston: Did you receive any order in the form of a cable or any other fashion to conduct an investigation?

Mr. Halley: I don't recall receiving one, but if you showed me a cable, I would have to comment on it. In other words this was in 1963. This is 1976, and as you know from your record, I've been in an awful lot of high volume projects since that time, and I don't think it is likely that I would recall a specific cable, you know, on a particular day. I mean, I have been in Berlin, Laos, Vietnam. My life has been active, therefore I do not recall a specific cable. If you've got a cable, I'd be glad to comment on it.

Mr. Johnston: Well, I don't have one, and I'm asking you whether one would exist.

Mr. Halley: I don't recall one.

Mr. Johnston: And your judgment would be that there was not a cable ordering an investigation.

Mr. Halley: I can't say that. I can only say that I don't recall one, but I do recall that at a later point, once Oswald was detained by the police and there was some investigative material emanating from that, we participated in name trace activity of whatever was sent to us of that type from Washington, because I do recall that at the time that the name traces were conducted, that one of the Cuban groups that we were in touch with at DRE, they did come up with a tape of a debate which had taken place between Oswald and a member of the DRE in New Orleans, and you know, that sort of sticks in my mind as an event of that particular time. And we commented on it, and as I recall, forwarded the tapes to Washington.

Senator Schweiker: That was Bringuier's group, was it not?

Mr. Halley: That was the DRE, the Dirección Revolucionario.

Senator Schweiker: Wasn't Carlos Bringuier - maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong - involved in that, and wasn't he associated with you folks at that time?

TOP SECRET

Mr. Halley: Well, I don't recall that specific name, Senator, at this time. We did have a relationship with the DRE. We did deal with a number of their top leaders.

Mr. Johnston: Let me come back to that later. Did you receive any orders not to investigate an area, or not to conduct an investigation of any kind?

Mr. Halley: No, I don't recall receiving any such orders.

Mr. Johnston: At this time period, November 22nd, November 23rd, 1963, what was your capability in regard to conducting an investigation among Cuban exiles, and with Cuban sources?

Mr. Halley: Well, in relationship to Cubans living in the United States, I would say that our capability was quite good.

Mr. Johnston: Now you are referring to our capability to conduct an investigation in Cuba, I would have to say it was limited. I have to know where specifically you are referring to. In other words, if you're talking in the area of -

Mr. Johnston: First I'm taking domestically of Cuban exiles in the United States, and your answer is -

Mr. Halley: that it would have been quite good.

Mr. Johnston: Secondly, with regard to collecting intelligence as to possible Cuban involvement -

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

Mr. Halley: From Cuba or in Cuba?

Mr. Johnston: Any other source.

Mr. Halley: Well, if you're talking about collecting information in Cuba -

Mr. Johnston: I see.

Mr. Halley: It would then have to be focused specifically on different geographic areas. In other words, as an example, if you told me I want some information on a specific town in the province of Pinar del Rio, that probably was within our capability at that time because we had a rather extensive network in Pinar del Rio. If you had said to me, you know, in that same time it on this day, I want you to conduct a kind of an investigation in the province of Camaguey, I probably would have had to say, you know, we're not as well equipped, because our coverage varied from province to province.

Mr. Johnston: Did you have sources and I mean specifically JMWAVE station, did JMWAVE station control sources in Cuban intelligence?

Mr. Halley: I don't recall that we had any staff officers in the Cuban intelligence service under our control. We may have been involved in some double agent operations at that time, but certainly we did not have a staff officer penetration of the Cuban services.

Mr. Johnston: Did you ever receive any orders to contact whatever your contacts were in the Cuban intelligence, to

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

inquire about the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Halley: I don't recall receiving any such instructions.

Mr. Johnston: Did that ever occur to you on your own?

Mr. Halley: Well, I think as you probably see from some of the traffic, we did come up on our own with samplings of opinion, what was happening in the Cuban community. We were reporting what was coming out of Cuba in terms of information brought by, you know, refugees, material that was being made available through people corresponding and so forth, yes, we were sensitive to that particular problem.

Mr. Johnston: But did you affirmatively go out and seek the information from sources in Cuba?

Mr. Halley: Well, to the extent that this was available to us, you know, we had lots of agents. If you're asking me did we send an S message and task a specific agent to conduct an investigation, or did we send them a radio message or something like that, I don't recall one.

Mr. Johnston: Why didn't you do that?

Mr. Halley: My recollection of this is that we felt that the nature of our capability was to simply respond to what we were able to obtain in the Miami area, and from our sources in a passive way, because this was an investigation that was being conducted in the United States with the primary responsibility with agencies other than CIA.

Mr. Johnston: I guess I don't quite understand the answer

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

because the CIA did have responsibility and certainly the capability to collect information from foreign countries.

Mr. Halley: Well, we had no reason at the particular time to feel that there was any kind of a case, hard information, that the Cubans were behind the assassination. In other words, you know, at that particular period in time there were a large number of rumors, gossip, in the Cuban Community. Those that came to our attention were reported, and we tried to put them in some perspective, characterize who was the individual, what access did he have to this data and so forth. But we had no persuasion that this was being mounted by the Cubans at that particular time.

Mr. Wallach: I would like to ask a couple of questions by way of background and let Jim go right back to his line of questioning. Taking the period as exemplary, October of 1963 -

Mr. Halley: Uh-huh.

Mr. Wallach: October of '63, okay, which I take it would be fairly indicative of what was going on in May, June, July and August of that same year, I want to pick a fairly standard month for that period.

Mr. Halley: Uh-huh.

Mr. Wallach: Before the assassination, it's my understanding that in addition to getting positive

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

intelligence from refugees, etc., coming to this country, that your station did operate agents and did have sources, whatever terms you want to use, inside Cuba, is that correct?

Mr. Halley: Yes, we did have sources inside Cuba.

Mr. Wallach: (Pause)

Mr. Wallach: Could you briefly for the record - what I'd like to do very briefly for the record, as you know, I think you had an interview with Mr. Baron and went into it with you, but very briefly describe generally the type of operations that your station was conducting vis-a-vis Cuba?

Mr. Halley: Well, in the first instance, we were engaged in foreign intelligence collection activities, that is, trying to establish information which related to the plans, intentions and capabilities of the Cuban government. We were also involved in counterintelligence operations, that is, trying to figure out what the Cubans were doing in terms of their intelligence operations in the United States, or through the United States into Central and Latin America. We were involved in propaganda operations against Cuba, and covert action in the sense of trying to establish contact with dissident military personalities in Cuba.

Mr. Wallach: Without naming names, did you in the time period I've been talking about, October of 1963, have either sources or agents fairly highly placed within the Cuban government?

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

Mr. Halley: I don't think there - I'd have to get a better definition from you of what is highly placed. If you are talking about Fidel Castro and his immediate entourage -

Mr. Wallach: People who could possibly have been in meetings or dinner with Castro, or meetings with Castro. I don't know enough about how Castro operated.

Mr. Halley: I would say if you are talking about somebody who was a member of his immediate entourage and who was dealing with him in a governmental sense, then the answer is no, but we did have people who were on the periphery of this, his entourage. That is, they wouldn't have been major participants, but they would have been in social contact with Castro or members of his entourage.

Mr. Wallach: How about persons within the DGI, whatever the correct name for Cuban intelligence is.

Mr. Halley: Well, again as I mentioned earlier, we had no staff officer penetration of the Cuban intelligence service. We had some reporting on people who were in touch with various leaders in the Cuban intelligence, and it was all social or family or other context that these people were reporting on.

Mr. Wallach: Do you recall at any time in 1962 or '63 the fact being brought to your attention that certain Cuban agents out of New York City were actually beginning to run

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

assassination plots against Cuban exile leaders down in Miami?

Mr. Halley: Out of New York? No, I don't recall that.

One thing, just before we leave this, so we don't have an incomplete record, you asked me the other kinds of operations that we were running. We were running a full scope of paramilitary operations against Cuba. That is, we were putting people back into Cuba who may have come from a particular province, and who then went into the bush and lived in the bush, and we kept them supplied with food, arms, basic equipment. We did have radio contact with them. We were involved in raids against the Cuban coast, we were involved in putting caches into the Cuban coast.

Senator Schweiker: Does that finish your point?

Mr. Halley: Yes, sir, that's roughly it.

Senator Schweiker: Following up this other question, was any one part of your job plugging intelligence leaks at this given time? Was there any concern during your timeframe that you were involved in Cuban operations of Intelligence Leaks from this country to theirs through the Cuban intelligence system? Was this ever a consideration or priority of you as Station Chief?

Mr. Halley: Well, yes, the answer to that is yes. Now, let me elaborate on it. Yes, in terms of -

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

We had a jurisdictional problem. For instance, a Cuban agent detected in the United States or being suspected of being a Cuban agent would have been a case that we would have had to have coordinated with the FBI, and essentially the FBI took primary action on this.

I recall one case where we detected a Cuban agent in the United States, and the case was transferred to the Bureau and it involved a fundamental jurisdictional issue, which was clearly the Bureau's right to take that particular case over. So in that sense, the primary responsibility in the Miami area in the counterintelligence sense that you are discussing Senator, would have rested with the Bureau.

Senator Schweiker: Did you ever attempt to find a leak by placing one of our agents into the system to plug a leak? I mean, was it ever that magnitude of concern attached?

Mr. Halley: No, I don't recall that kind of a case. In other words, I do recall cases where people came out of Cuba, gave us a story that we did not necessarily believe, where we would turn them back and send them back to Cuba, so that over a longer period of time we could determine what it is that they were really after, what they were trying to do. In other words, were they trying to come into the United States to penetrate and immigrate, were they trying to get in touch with America intelligence, and if so, why. But it was all done back into the Cuban context.

Senator Schweiker: This is a tough question to answer, but at that period of time, how successful in your opinion was the Cuban Intelligence system in doing some of that penetration, and I realize that we had a lot of Cuban exiles here, and it is pretty hard to tell the players from the scorecard we are in. It is a tough relevant question, but I wonder how you would analyze it.

Mr. Halley: Well, I think it would be fair to say that given the Cuban propensity to talk, in other words, you have to start off with a fundamental point of departure that if you get two Cubans that have got a secret, it is not going to be a secret, because they do talk, and therefore they all constantly talk. Our biggest problem in maintaining security of our own operations, such as an infiltration operation into Cuba to put in a cache or run a commando raid or put a person back in was to maintain security. The only way we could do it would be to take all participants of that operation and take them out of the Cuban community and in fact isolate them for a week of ten days or more prior to the mounting of the operation so that they wouldn't talk, and we could know where they would be constantly, 24 hours a day. And within that milieu, I think it is safe to say that the Cuban Intelligence service did have some agents and could be expected to have a general feel for the pulse of the community at that time.

Senator Schweiker: During the same time frame, or during the time frame that you were Station Chief, what are some other Cuban groups that you worked with that come to mind? I have mentioned DRE. I realize there were several different ones. Any others particularly that were helpful and worked with you like the DRE?

Mr. Halley: Well, the DRE was the main group because what had happened is after the or prior to the Bay of Pigs there was a great collaboration between CIA and a number of these groups. After the Bay of Pigs, the dialogue with these groups sort of dried up, and during my tenure, the main group that we worked with in that sense as an organizational entity was the DRE because they had a lot of active, imaginative young student leaders who had contacts throughout the Western Hemisphere who were equally interested in using them in the propaganda and covert action sense in Central and Latin America as we were actually using them against Cuba itself.

Senator Schweiker: Where did Alpha 66 fit into that?

Mr. Halley: We did not have an organizational relationship with Alpha 66. Alpha 66 was in being. We monitored these activities so that we would know when they were going to do raids against Cuba. We may have had people who at one time or another were in our paramilitary corps who left us for

NW#: 55510

TOP SECRET

one reason or another and may have ended up in Alpha 66.

Senator Schweiker: We realize that one of the other intelligence agencies might have had a liaison or working operation with Alpha 66, not the CIA, is that correct?

Mr. Halley: Yes, I think, you know, in the back of my memory I believe that one of the military services -

Senator Schweiker: Might it have been the Army Intelligence?

Mr. Halley: My recollection, it was probably a military service, and it probably was the Army, but I would have to check the record.

Senator Schweiker: We also were informed, and I just wondered if this was your recollection, that at some point some of the operations got a little bit overlapping and duplicating, and that the boats would - I'm simplifying it of course, but that the boats weren't coordinated too well, and at one point it got to be a problem with whoever else was involved, and that finally an agreement was worked out with Army intelligence that all the boats would be supplied by CIA instead of having them sort of fly-by-nighting and possibly mess up some things because of duplication or confusion. Do you recall any of that at all?

Mr. Halley: Well, I think there were periods when the U.S. Government was putting a clamp-down on refugee groups going out, and the whole apparatus of government, Coast Guard,

NW#: 55510
DocId: 32423435
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

TOP SECRET

Customs, Immigration and Naturalization, FBI, CIA, were working together to try to keep these operations from going to Cuba. In that context, the military did have some problems, but my recollection of that, Senator, is that we put them into the coordination mechanism that we had for getting boats out. I don't recall our taking their people -

Senator Schweiker: I might have stated it wrong. What do you mean by a coordination mechanism?

Mr. Halley: Well, for instance, we had let's say, for the month of October 1963, we would draw up an operational plan in September. In the course of that operational plan in relationship to the dark of the moon, we would have a number of infiltration missions scheduled to put in caches. We'd have a number of missions scheduled to put in teams or to take people out of Cuba. We'd have a number of missions scheduled to conduct commando raids against fixed installations. So we would draw up the schedule and coordinate the schedule with the appropriate agencies like Coast Guard or Customs so that we could move our boats in and out and not cause the U.S. Government to expend manhours and money in pursuing our boats.

Senator Schweiker: I think that is what I had in mind.

Mr. Halley: And therefore, on this schedule, when we worked this out, we therefore would tack on the military operations and work this out so that there was a central

NW#: 55510
