1. The September Progress Report for AMSPELL, including AMHINT and AMBARB activities, is transmitted herewith:

A. AMSPELL

1) General:

a. On 21 September 1962, AMHINT-53 exfiltrated PBRUMEN in a refugee vessel and made his preliminary operational report on release from CAC on 22 September (Reference B). Subject was accompanied by the National Coordinator for Agricultural Affairs (actually an organizer for guerrilla warfare and resistance groups throughout the Island) Jose Angel LOZANO y Lozano. Briefly, AMHINT-53 and LOZANO rendered an optimistic operational report on AMSPELL organization in PBRUMEN, including the situation in the underground, compartmentation, organization, communications control and intelligence structure. Subjects are undergoing intelligence debriefing on a continuing basis.

b. While AMHINT-53 was arranging his exfiltration and AMSPELL Psywar operations in PBRUMEN and the hemisphere were continued on their normal course, the AMHINTs were still smarting from the ODYOKE confiscation of their vessel, the JUANINAI, as a consequence of the 24 August attack on Havana. AMHINT-2 went to Caracas on 7 September for a meeting with President BETANCOURT (or his official representative) and a press conference where he released an AMSPELL statement, which in effect, served a notice on PBRUMEN and the USSR that any Communist shipping encountered in PBRUMEN territorial waters will be attacked on sight. (Reference F and G)

c. Behind the scenes, however, AMHINT-2 was reportedly (Reference D and E) negotiating with Venezuelan Naval Officials for surfacecraft and possibly a base from which to operate. What success he achieved in this quest, or to what extent President BETANCOURT is prepared to help AMSPELL, is still an unknown quantity. Judging from their attempts to raise funds in other spheres, allegedly for the purchase of a replacement vessel, they were not very successful in Caracas. (A PM Case Officer handling the CEDAR team has reported that one of the members complained of forfeiting a 20-percent "kick-back" in his AMSPELL salary. (For a breakdown of AMSPELL salary see Attachment B.)

d. AMHINT-2 returned from Caracas and as to be expected, gave no indication of the "secret negotiations" or their outcome. On 27 September, along with AMHINT-5, he requested a meeting with the JMWAVE officer for discussion of the AMBARB funding disagreement and the general AMSPELL situation (See Attachment C). Perhaps this session gave JMWAVE a bit more insight as to AMSPELL plans and intentions, but no real solution for the AMBARBs resulted. In short, AMSPELL policy is to mold PBPRIME public opinion and bring pressure to bear on ODYOKE and GPIDEAL for action in the PBRUMEN situation within the next four months.

e. To implement such a policy, AMSPELL has exploited the impact of their 24 August attack on PBPRIME news media, as well as their Caracas Declaration. Also, they have published a weekly news letter in English entitled "The Cuban Report" (Reference C) and about 1,000 copies are mailed out to ODYOKE officials and congressmen. Initiated in late August, the main theme of this publication has been the Soviet/Bloc materiel buildup in PBRUMEN. (See Attachment A)

2) Total AMSPELL Support for September 1962: $50,960.40

a. AMBARB Section: Salaries $12,240.00, Operations $7,700.00, Processing $1,020.40 = $20,960.40

b. AMHINT Section: Support $5,000.00

c. AMSPELL General: Salaries $9,000.00, Overhead $2,100.00, Operations $13,900.00 = $25,000.00

CLASSIFICATION: S-E-C-R-E-T

UFGA-6140

3) Intelligence Production:

UFG-1572 - "Status of Equipment at the Nico Lopez Refinery & UK, Czech, and Soviet Assistance in its maintenance; Shipment of Gold Bullion from the Refinery to the USSR."

UFG-1585 (As above)

UFG-1607 (As above)

UFG-1622 (As above)

UFG-1628 (As above)

4) Development and Plans: All planning phases of AMSPELL activities supported by JMWAVE at the present time are subject to the results of meetings with AMSPELL concerning increased control, and, the decisions of JMWAVE to continue a support relationship if an acceptable degree of KUBARK control can be established.

B. AMHINTS:

1) General:

a. As reported in Reference B, the most important AMHINT development during September was the exfiltration of AMHINT-53. This was also significant for JMWAVE, since all negotiations with AMSPELL would be transferred from AMHINT-2 to AMHINT-53. Although AMHINT-53 will undoubtedly be fully briefed and re-indoctrinated by AMHINT leaders concerning AMSPELL present status and operational relationship with JMWAVE, AMHINT-53 is a mature and astute leader and can be expected to appreciate the broad scope of JMWAVE-AMSPELL operations.

b. In the Psywar field, the AMHINTs in PBRUMEN continue to produce "Trinchera" on a hand-operated mimeograph machine in Havana and distribute about 10,000 copies monthly. They are also committed to the collection and transmission of reports and photographs on the Soviet buildup, at least until the DAMSON intelligence operations are begun. This activity is in direct support of the AMSPELL policy cited in Paragraph A.1)e above. The AMSPELL propaganda section is divided into four departments to carry out this program: PBRUMEN, Latin American, PBRUMEN Exile Community and PBPRIME.

c. Diplomatic pouches intercepted for JMWAVE by AMBLEAK-1 have revealed much of AMSPELL operational planning not heretofore reported. In a series of letters written by the AMSPELL national coordinators in exile to their opposite numbers in PBRUMEN on 20 September, it was indicated that:

i. Negotiations by AMHINT-2 in Caracas, Costa Rica and Panama are practically completed for an AMSPELL operations base. (Letter from Bernabe PENE to AMHINT-40)

ii. AMSPELL has levied intelligence requirements on AMHINTS in PBRUMEN for sending out information on PBRUMEN ports that can be attacked from the sea. (Intelligence Plans Numbers 5, 6 and 7, in a letter from AMHINT-39 to "Jesus", National Coordinator for Intelligence.)

iii. In the interim, reports on Mariel, Cabanas, Bahia Honda, La Habana, Matanzas and Cardenas are requested on a continuing basis.

CLASSIFICATION: S-E-C-R-E-T

UFGA-6140

d. Subsequently, In an incoming pouch and probably crossing with the foregoing communications, a series of letters from the National Coordinators in PBRUMEN reported a severe blow to AMSPELL clandestine organization. Jore MEDINA Bringier ("Mongo"), National Coordinator for Military Reception and Supply, reported that AMHINT-40 (PBRUMEN National Coordinator) had been missing. (Later reported as arrested and being held at G-2 Headquarters on Ave 5 in Miramar.) Also, "Juan" and "Miguel" were arrested in Havana. Several others were missing. MEDINA went on to describe security measures implemented and report on a re-organization of the National Coordinator Committee. He closed with a plea for a small shipment of small arms for defensive use, clothing and medicine, and a full-scale propaganda effort if AMHINT-40 should be sentenced to summary execution.

e. In this same pouch, the National Coordinator for Propaganda, Nicolas PEREZ Diez-Arguelles ("Jose Alfredo") rendered a detailed report on Agit/Prop assets in PBRUMEN. The printing and distribution of "Trinchera" has been moved up to every fortnight, and efforts to get it printed on a commercial printing press in Havana appear to be successful. Regular couriers are being trained for delivery of the newspaper to the provinces. PEREZ also reported their progress in mounting two clandestine radio transmitters for Agit/Prop purposes, one in Las Villas and one in Havana. These are powered by 110 volt generators usually found on a small farm. It is projected to transmit a regular program, probably entitled "Tele-periodico Trinchera". The report does not explain what counter measures will be taken to prevent GOC detection. Finally, PEREZ describes an Agit/Prop program already in progress: First a plan for printing and marking walls with their organization abbreviation, carried out in one operation, synchronizing municipal and borough teams for the job. As a follow-up phase, large cloth banners bearing the same letters will be raised or tended in congested areas and photographs taken for publication in "Trinchera". Also, with the aid of their Intelligence Section, AMHINTs have penetrated two radio stations in Havana and are identifying all Sov/Bloc personnel employed there, their security practices, addresses and routes for commuting.

2) Total AMHINT Support for September 1962: $5,000.00 (Included in AMSPELL General section of this report)

3) Intelligence Production: (Reported in AMSPELL General Section.)

4) Development & Plans: (See this section under AMSPELL General of this report)

C. AMBARB

During the reporting period no changes occurred in AMBARB personnel assignments. With the exfiltration of AMHINT-53 from PBRUMEN it is hoped that it will be possible to negotiate with AMBARB the still unsettled question of AMBARB funding. We will report further to Headquarters as soon as an agreement is reached with AMBARB on funding of AMBARB representatives in the field by local KUBARK Stations. For the present it can only be said that the AMBARB leaders are strenuously resisting any effort by JMWAVE to increase to more than eight the number of their people whom they will permit KUBARK to fund directly rather than through AMBARB Headquarters in Miami.

The inspection tour of AMBARB-16 to delegations in Latin America resulted in the general report, forwarded for your information as Attachment D: in reading this report, it is useful for reference purposes to examine Attachment E a report which the AMBARB office has prepared on its general progress since inception of the AMBARB program. As Attachment F we forward a special report prepared by AMBARB-16 on AMBARB mailing operations capabilities.

Individual reports on the activities of AMBARB overseas delegations are forwarded in the following Attachments, which Headquarters may wish to bring to the attention of KUBARK Area Divisions or Stations as it deems best:

G. Bolivia
H. Brazil
I. Costa Rica
J. Chile
K. Colombia
L. Ecuador
M. Mexico
N. Panama
O. Peru
P. Uruguay
Q. Venezuela

The AMBARB salary schedule for September is forwarded as Attachment R.

REPORT

During the recent trip I made through the delegations in Latin America, the results of the sending of propaganda to Cuba were reported to me. For the better understanding of the results reached, we will now explain them within each Delegation visited.

The Delegation at Venezuela sent some months ago the propaganda we sent them to be mailed to Cuba. They used the lists of addresses given by Roger.

The propaganda reared in Venezuela has continued this system using the props edited by the Venezuela Delegation. A total of 1,700 letters was sent at day, June, and July, mailing them from Caracas one month, from Maracaibo another month, and from Barquisimeto another. All security measures were filled (that they be sent by different persons with different handwriting, but regular, and not commemorative, stamps be used, ordinary envelopes, and mailed in different post offices, etc.)

The Delegation has sent the propaganda given by Roger, but no reply was obtained from any person. It stated the security means and the conditions for the sending of the props and ca. The Delegation remarked on the risk run with mail and the violations to which it is subject in Brazil (they explained that the salaries of post office employees are so low that they take off the stamps from the letters when they have not been marked, to sell them, and then they destroy the letters.)

They sent 1,500 letters during day, June, and July.

The Delegation could not send the propaganda to Chile because we had no Delegation there.

The Delegation sent the third grade propaganda to Chile, which is the propaganda about the members of the 26th of July that are imprisoned or have been executed. They sent 1,000 letters.

The list of addresses has to be previously checked up, because there are persons in it actually working in the underground, and the sending of propaganda addressed to them could, consequently, place them under suspect danger.

While AMHINT-2 is now in PBPRIME, he will determine AMSPELL policy as approved by the AMSPELL Executive Committee. However, the activities of the last four months were planned and controlled by AMHINT and assisting him were AMINTs and Bernabe PENA, who were present at the meeting. After the AMSPELL discussion, the meeting turned into a long discussion of the International Communist situation, ODYOKE, KUBARK and AMSPELL policies as related to this situation. Some of the noteworthy items revealed:

a. AMSPELL had the 24 August Havana attack plan for six months, but had shelved it for the "right time" and a considered decision not to embark upon a course independent of KUBARK approval. The Sov/Bloc buildup changed that decision.

b. AMSPELL analyzes the situation as hopeless for the PBRUMEN revolutionary movements after four months because:

1- The Soviets will be firmly established and ODYOKE policy as defined by GPIDEAL tends toward and will probably result in a hemisphere non-acceptance of PBRUMEN as a satellite.

2- After four months, the degree of police controls, repression and persecution will make any internal action in civic resistance and guerrilla warfare virtually impossible.

c. AMSPELL feels that ODYOKE policy on PBRUMEN cannot be influenced by the rising tide of public opinion and congressional action, partly because GPIDEAL is surrounded by a group of advisors who are "one step from being parlor pinks or worse". The list began with Chester BOWLES.

d. This situation is not an original AMSPELL observation. During his European travel in August, AMHINT-2 went to the Vatican for a meeting (claimed to be high level) which had been arranged some time ago. His impression of thinking in the Vatican re World Communist advance, was that ODYOKE or PBPRIME was no longer calculated as an effective power for defending the world against total takeover. That the Catholic Church was beginning the long process of preparing their forces for a world dominated by Communism.

e. As a result of their observations and analysis, AMSPELL has assumed a "now or never" attitude and policy. They feel they must resort to tactics that mold PBPRIME public opinion and bring pressure to bear on ODYOKE and GPIDEAL for action in the PBRUMEN situation. Latin America must also be kept aware and urged to support an action. They would hope that such an AMSPELL policy and resultant activity would not be interpreted as opposition or hostility to KUBARK or ODYOKE, and that their KUBARK relationship would survive the critical months before them. They recognize that KUBARK is bound by policy and burdened by a bureaucracy, and feel that the actions - although independent and uncontrolled - of AMSPELL might contribute to the formation of action policy in PBRUMEN, despite consternation in ZRETAIL.

Harold R. NORMAYR

1. The meeting with AMHINT-2 was to clarify the continuing misunderstanding and disagreement over AMBARB funding. The original AMHINT meeting with AMHINT-2 was reviewed, and AMHINT-2 pointed out that it was not agreed that KUBARK stations would pay all AMBARBs, but only the coverts. Without going over the entire evolution of the AMBARB project funding, it was pointed up to AMHINT that the project was a two-way arrangement, of great mutual convenience, and we must find a functional "middle-ground" upon which to operate, although it may not be entirely satisfactory to either of the parties. AMHINT-2 agreed, and the following ground rules were arrived at as workable funding plans:

a. AMBARBs assigned as overt AMSPELL representatives will be funded by AMSPELL from Miami on all future assignments. Those now being funded by station will remain status quo.

b. Covert AMBARBs for station contact will be assigned by individual processing, both parties agreed, and station will fund and control.

c. Re the four pending cases where stations have requested funding as soon as possible - a meeting is to be held where each case will be considered individually and decided upon.

2. While this arrangement is not entirely acceptable, it is believed that upon the return of AMHINT-53 to the operational control, a better arrangement can be made.

SUBJECT: Eduardo Ruiz's trip to Latin America.

This report is aimed at narrating briefly the results of Mr. Eduardo Ruiz's recent trip to several countries of Latin America carried through for the purpose of visiting the D.R.E. Delegations.

In order to make easier the understanding of its points, we will outline the impressions gathered throughout the different countries according to the order in which they were visited, and divide them into the following aspects:

A. Actual situation of the delegation
B. Deficiencies
C. Future possibilities.

VENEZUELA

A. Actual situation of the delegation.

Undoubtedly, the Delegation at Venezuela is at present the best delegation the D.R.E. has in Latin America.

There are many reasons for which this Delegation has reached to occupy the first place in the Latin American Plan of the D.R.E. Summing them they are the following:

1. It is identified with the nation's problems and national aims.

2. Team-work coordination and unity in the accomplishment of labor.

3. A high sense of duty and a skillful plan of labor intelligently organized.

Consequently, the Delegation at Venezuela has succeeded in attaining high prestige for the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil on the most representative elements and institutions of the Venezuelan people are receiving their ideals with ours. The central management of the Delegation at Venezuela is located in Caracas. It is a small office situated at a central city point.

It has two sub-delegations, one in Maracaibo, a northern city of Venezuela, under the direction of Roberto Freemon Celuru, and Ricardo Enriquez, and the other one in Barquisimeto.

At the central office of the Delegation in Venezuela under the direction of Rafael Fremos, General Delegate of the D.R.E. in Venezuela, Jose Miguel del Llorente, Lorenzo Martin, Joaquin Perez, and Luis Boza are actually working. In Caracas, the D.R.E. transmits a daily radio broadcast which lasts for 30 minutes. Also in Maracaibo the D.R.E. transmits a radio broadcast which holds great popularity. (it is interesting to point out as a proof for the adverse effects of this broadcast that a group of action men of the communist party tried to burn with Molotov bombs the radio station which transmits the broadcast).

The labor accomplished by the D.R.E. in the student field is of vital importance. At present the Delegation has one possibility of moving enough forces in a definitive moment to counteract Communist action inside the University which is totally controlled by Communists.

We can also point out as highly important the so called "personality building courses" which were created by the members of the D.R.E. and which are carried through today due to intimate cooperation, among the D.R.E., the Government, the Christian Social Party and ecclesiastical hierarchy. Each of these courses lasts for approximately one week and they are generally given for approximately one week and are generally given for approximately 35 attendants and are suited during one week to strong military discipline and intensive formation which lasts until night. During the activities of the day with a General Assembly in which the results attained during the day, are discussed. I had the opportunity to assist personally at one of these courses which was being given by Ricardo Rodriguez of the D.R.E. Delegation at Maracaibo, in a fund given by the Venezuelan government for such purposes. Up to the present 1,200 Venezuelan Students have received these courses and, certainly, their effects have influenced greatly in the consolidation of the democratic system in Venezuela.

We could now talk of the many other activities of the Delegation but that would result in extending the report. That is why we have only pointed out the most important.

B. Deficiencies

Generally, we could assert that the balance maintained by the D.R.E. Delegation at Venezuela on this aspect cannot be more positive.

Excepting the logical and natural deficiencies the labor is greatly due to the limitations, the Delegation at Venezuela does not have deficiencies of importance. On the other hand, the Delegation at Venezuela presented to me a complaint which is also made by the rest of the Delegations, which I will explain further on.

It is that the Delegation has been on several occasions under emotional pressures motivated by the large periods of time it goes through with no visits by anyone of the Central Office of International Relations. In others, the D.R.E. Delegations in Venezuela asked through all its members more frequent visits in order to avoid a feeling of forlornness during our common struggle.

C. Future possibilities
