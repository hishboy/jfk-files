ARMS SHIPMENTS

Arms smuggling is one of the "facts of life" in Latin America and has been engaged in by dissident elements for many years. Reports of Castro involvement in these activities have been frequent since shortly after his seizure of power early in 1959. None of these reports has ever been proven. With the arrival of large quantities of Soviet Bloc arms in late 1961, Cuba recovered all U.S. arms in the hands of the populace and made it a crime punishable by death to have possession of weapons of U.S. manufacture. The U.S. arms furnished under the MAP to former Cuban regiments together with those collected by Castro provide the Castro government with large stocks which could be shipped to subversive groups in other countries. Identification of these arms with Cuba would be extremely difficult.

Reports of Method of Operation

This Tab contains five items: (1) Two reports alleging arms smuggling by fishermen and by means of food products shipped to Latin America; (2) A report which indicates that a Cuban arms cache discovered in Brazil is not of Cuban origin; and (3) Two reports concerning a Cuban arsenal purportedly being used to supply arms for an invasion of some Caribbean country or an invasion of South America.

Reports of Arms Smuggling

This Tab contains a number of items reporting arms smuggling to Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela, British Guiana and Brazil. Note particularly the top item in which the British indicate the numerous reports on arms smuggling to British

NO FOR DISSEM

An arms cache of weapons and ammunition recently discovered at the Ligas Camponesas guerrilla training center in the interior of the Brazilian state of Goias is believed by US Embassy and CAS officers to be of Brazilian rather than Cuban arms, despite a Brazilian newspaper suggestion that they were Cuban. There were also discovered about 125 copies of Communist publications including Che Guevara's well-known treatise on "Guerrilla Warfare". The training center was described as organized according to that book. A confidential report on the discoveries added that "members of the center want to be the Brazilian equivalent of those who fought in the Sierra Maestra and so bring the hard Chinese-Cuban type revolution to Brazil." Some 90 to 95 persons in the locality are reported members of or sympathetic to the Ligas Camponesas activities, but only 2 of the 24 for whom warrants were issued have yet been taken into custody.

service, who visited Santiago de Cuba in August 1962,
Appraisal of Content: 3.

Soviet fishing boats, under cover of fishing Atlantic waters,
are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.
The boats are met outside the territorial waters of those
countries, and arms are transferred in small quantities.

On board the Soviet boats are only Soviets and a very few
Cubans or other Latin Americans who talk with those who
pick up the arms. The arms being delivered are of American
manufacture, including those obtained during the Batista
regime and those taken during the Playa Giron invasion. The
Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda and pamphlets
containing military instructions, the same type of material
being sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico.

A Belgian in Habana who says he represents a Belgian firm,
has offered the Cuban Government any type and nationality
of arms for payment in dollars. The Belgian has made a
similar offer of sale of arms to a representative of an
anti-Castro group in Habana.

In August 1962 a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that
on several occasions he had been forced by the Government
to use his boat for transporting small groups of men, in
civilian clothes, and supplies of arms. He also knew of
other fishermen who had been forced to do the same. The men
and arms were carried to small islands or transferred to other
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long as four or
five days. The fisherman did not know the purpose or final
destination of the men and arms.

Venezuela Uncovers Communist Arms Cache

The Venezuelan Government -- in a raid on a small village near Caracas on 5 January -- uncovered a large cache of arms and equipment which it claims belonged to the pro-Castro Armed Forces of National Liberation, reputed to be emerging as a para-military arm of the Venezuelan Communist Party. Several tons of explosives and large quantities of hand bombs, arms, and ammunition were seized as well as a nearby clandestine Communist radio transmitter. (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

ARMS SHIPMENTS

12 Feb 63 "All the information available to Her Majesty's Government and to the British authorities in British Guiana indicates that there is no truth whatever in the continuing reports that arms are being shipped to the colony from Cuba. Similar stories have appeared from time to time in the past, but upon examination all have been found to be without foundation."

(British Embassy in US to Reuters, AP and UPI).

HW 50955 DocId: 32423736 Page 14

1. The 7 February 1963 edition of LIFE contains story on Cuba with following caption under photo of Russian freighter: "But refugees aboard the Shirley Lykes said two ships put out from Mariel (Cuba) only last week with holds loaded with weapons sent by Castro to British Guiana."

2. A debrief report of a tested CIA source on 25 January 1963 states that a Port Everglades informant told him that a blatant only master for the Port of Havana said that on 14 January 1963 two launches captained by a man with what appeared to be an Italian accent had departed from the La Coubre wharf (Havana). The manifest on ship indicated the destination was British Guiana. The ship sector had been told by the master that launches were loaded with arms. TD/00-3249316 DTG 201505Z

3. The following information may refer to this arms shipment. An untested CIA source, a member of the Communist Party of Colombia in Cali, has stated that during a conversation on 3 January 1963 between Amado de la Vega Zarath, member of the Department of Valle Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia (PCC), and P.I. Plata, a Cuban deep-cover agent working with the Seventh of January Worker-Student-Peasant Movement (MOEC), in Colombia and Venezuela, Plata said that the MOEC is not a local movement but rather a part of a Latin American concept being assisted by Castro and the Cuban Government. Plata has been in Cali for one year on a special assignment from the top leaders in Cuba to see that arms, propaganda, and instructions from Venezuela, originating in Cuba, get into the hands of the MOEC groups.

Plata said that a local movement for MOEC is due to arrive from Venezuela, capital of the Department of Valle, near the Venezuela border and that the shipment is radical for MOEC. Ref RD-W-2107

SECRET

4. Another report may also refer to this arms shipment. According to information dated 1 February 1963 from a CIA source and appraised by the CIA preparing office as possibly true, Pedro Matos, who together with the three-member regional command committee of the Partido Comunista de Venezuela (PCV) in the state of Zulia is responsible for PCV arms matters in that state, said recently that the party is awaiting a shipment of arms from Cuba and Panama but that the exact date of arrival is still unknown. CIA Report TDCS-3/536,942, dd 9 Feb 63 of IN 64876

5. Replies to DIA SICA's on this subject from NBA and CNO do not indicate any vessels departing Havana on or after 14 January bound for British Guiana, nor do State Department queries to Georgetown, British Guiana indicate the arrival of any arms. No reports have been received from service attaches in Venezuela or from sources in Panama concerning this particular matter.

The British consul in Santiago de Cuba has informed Washington and the Governor of British Guiana that two alleged US citizens, John Allram Johnson, aged 53, and his wife Margaret Frances Johnson, were leaving Cuba on 31 December on the Cuban vessel BAITA DE TAIAMA destined for Georgetown, British Guiana. On board with them were 17 cases in their name, including two large wood crates understood to be "very similar to those recently unloaded from a Soviet Union ship in Santiago de Cuba." The British consul notes the unlikelihood of US citizens' leaving Cuba in this manner, and the resulting doubt as to their real identities and intentions.

nine years, and on his latest trip had several conversations with Jagan.

In talking with me, Jagan has made clear that he is not a "Castro Type."
He wants help from anybody. The one thing that might in the future
seriously hinder his getting economic aid by the USSR is that he
demands that aid be without strings.
