Memo for File - William P. Burke

Subject: Longevity Step Increase

In reviewing this file under the Security reinvestigation program, it was noted that the 3rd ISI (as GS-15) was proposed to be made effective on 13 Sept 60, but that the effective date had been changed by Payroll to show 16 Oct 60. Reason for the change is presumed to be due to LWOP. Form 560 shows 225 hours of LWOP during the waiting period. If those figures are correct, then there was no "excess" LWOP, since the law provides that a maximum of 240 hours of LWOP is creditable toward completion of the waiting period in the case of ISI's.

I called this case to the attention of Joe Tracy, C/Payroll, who-will review LWOP records and, if required, issue a memorandum to correct the effective date of the last LSI.

William P. Burke, Chief of the New Orleans Field Office, continues to manage his office in a thoroughly competent and efficient manner. Mr. Burke is a conservative who sometimes finds it difficult without most careful and protracted consideration of all factors involved to adjust to changes in methods and objectives particularly those peculiar to clandestine support. While his conservatism added to his meticulous legalistic approach might be something less than desirable in certain areas it is a definite asset in New Orleans. When called upon in-emergency he willingly and efficiently devotes his entire time and energy to the solution of the problem regardless of personal inconvenience. Mr. Burke represents the Agency well in his area and readily maintains respect in the community.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Director for Operations

SUBJECT: William P. Burke, Memorandum of Performance

1. William P. Burke, Chief of the New Orleans Field Office, continues to manage his office most efficiently and to demonstrate thorough knowledge of his area. His inherent conservatism and somewhat legalistic approach tend to make it difficult for him to accept change and methods peculiar to clandestine support without most careful consideration of all the factors involved.

2. Mr. Burke represents the Agency well in his area. His conservatism is to a degree an asset in New Orleans; it could conceivably be a handicap elsewhere.
