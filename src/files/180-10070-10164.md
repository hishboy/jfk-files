Special Assistant to the Treasurer
Office of the Treasurer of the
United States
Washington, D.C. 20220

Dear Mrs. Thornell:

I am sorry you feel that you were not treated fairly upon termination of your services with the Committee.

When I received your letter, I asked Tom Howarth to give me a memorandum outlining the terms of your settlement. Enclosed is a copy.

I am sure that after you read the memorandum, you will agree that the Committee was more than fair, especially in light of the fact there was no official leave policy at the time and thus, no obligation to pay any terminating compensation at all.

As to your main area of concern, the one-day break in service, Mr. Howarth's memorandum points out that such a break has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of your benefits.

I wish you every success in your new position with the Administration.

Sincerely,

Louis Stokes
Chairman

MEMORANDUM

TO: CHAIRMAN STOKES
FROM: THOMAS HOWARTH
BUDGET OFFICER
DATE: JUNE 14, 1977
RE: JOAN T. THORNELL, LETTER RE LEAVE

Mrs. Thornell left at the close of business on Friday, May 13, 1977. As the Committee had no leave policy at that time, she made her termination effective Sunday, May 15, 1977, at my suggestion, so that she would receive two days extra in pay.

Mrs. Thornell began employment November 8, 1976 and left May 13, 1977. Under the Clerk of the House's leave policy, she would be entitled to 5 days, no credit being given for a fraction of a month when hired or a fraction of a month when terminated.

The Clerk's policy further states there are no provisions to permit reimbursement to an employee upon termination for any accumulation of leave. However, to the extent possible and practicable, every effort should be made to consider such accumulation when submitting a recommendation for termination.

Twelve Committee Staff Members with a total of 42 days accumulated leave who have terminated, including one who terminated the same day as Mrs. Thornell, were given no credit for their leave because the Committee had no policy at that time.

This fact and the fact that Mrs. Thornell was paid for six days past May 13, in my opinion, discredits Mrs. Thornell claim to "the punitive nature of the decision." The facts clearly show that Mrs. Thornell was given special consideration.

For the record, Acting Chief Counsel Al Lewis was paid for no accumulated leave. After Mr. Lewis left the Committee, he was kept on the payroll long enough to recover his back salary which I understand was the Committee's request. (Mrs. Thornell had already recovered her back salary.)

As to Mrs. Thornell's break in service, I have been told by the Finance Office that such a break has no effect whatsoever on the transfer of her benefits.

THE TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20220

May 27, 1977

Hon. Louis B. Stokes
Chairman
Select Committee on Assassinations
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Chairman Stokes:

The circumstances of my departure from the Committee staff have saddened me because of the following:

On May 6, 1977, in writing (enclosed) I advised the then-Acting Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Alvin B. Lewis, Jr., of my intention to leave the staff as of May 15, 1977 plus whatever vacation time I had accrued since my date of entry to service, November 8, 1976.

Since there was no formal leave policy established by the Committee at the date of my notice and since I was aware of leave being extended to the Acting Chief Counsel who was also leaving service at about the same time, I began making inquiries about my own accrued leave.

On Thursday, May 12, Thomas Howarth, the Budget Officer, advised me verbally that he had not yet cleared with you the rate of leave to be extended to me in days accrued per month, but he thought that a rate of one day per month was going to be approved. On that basis, he calculated that I would be allowed 5 1/2 or 6 days of leave.

When I began a new appointment with a Federal agency on Monday, May 23, I called Mr. Howarth from the new personnel office to establish my date of termination in order to comply with the Federal law which prohibits Federal employees from receiving payment from more than one Federal source at a time. In other words, I was attempting to clear the date of May 23 as a starting date for the new employment.

At that time, Mr. Howarth advised that I had been terminated on May 19, based on a calculation of leave beginning May 14 for a total of 6 days -- which included counting weekend days in the leave period. At the time of our initial conversation, how-

NW 88326
DocId:32244106 Page 6

---

ever, I was not advised that weekend days would be counted in the calculation of the leave period.

He further advised that since the House payroll system is based on a 30-day month, for purposes of calculating a termination date he counted weekend days, whereas a vacationing employee who would be returning to work after vacation would not have weekend days counted. (I checked with the Committee on House Administration and learned that though each Committee establishes its own leave policy, it is unusual to penalize a terminating employee by counting in weekend days.)

Inasmuch as there was no written leave policy I had no way of anticipating his method of calculating leave. And because of the punitive nature of the decision I have suffered a break in service which may affect seriously my transfer of benefits from the House of Representatives to my new employment. Had I been aware of his method of calculating leave, my dates of departure from the Committee, obviously, would have been different.

I hope that you will review the calculation of my date of departure and act swiftly to rectify the situation to allow my termination date from the Committee to be set at Friday, May 20, 1977, which would reflect 5 working days leave from the Committee.

I have already acted to begin employment at the Department of the Treasury as of May 23. I gladly forfeit the 6th vacation day which would have been May 23.

Thank you in advance for your kind attention to this matter and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Joan Talbert Thornell
Special Assistant to the
Treasurer-Designate
