2025 RELEASE

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Two MVD Officers in Minsk Who Are Engaged in Surveillance of Foreigners

SOURCE: (201-0948382), A foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in various jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76
DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

The two MVD officers described in this report are part of a small (and otherwise unidentified) section of the Minsk City Internal Affairs Directorate (GUVD) on Dobromyshlenskiy pereulok (the subject of a separate report). This section is engaged in the surveillance of foreigners for the apparent purpose of identifying those of their Soviet contacts who may be black marketeers.

2. KOVALEV, Vladimir, whose nickname is "Boni", holds the rank of senior lieutenant. Born in about 1949, he is 174 cm tall, of medium build, and has slightly wavy short blond hair. He is very nearsighted and wears glasses. He dresses modestly and inconspicuously and has the appearance of an "educated and cultured" person.

3. KOVALEV is married to Tamara nee MATVEYEVA, and they have a son, born in about 1972, who attends a special kindergarden for the children of high-ranking and other privileged officials. KOVALEVA, the daughter of a retired KGB lieutenant colonel, is a graduate of an economics institute and works as a senior economist for the State Committee for Standards, earning 170 rubles per month. The KOVALEVs live on Bobruyskaya ulitsa directly opposite a bus station.

4. KOVALEV is a graduate of the Minsk State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages, where he studied Spanish and English in the Department of Translating. After graduation, KOVALEV left Minsk for one year to go into the Army. However, Source found this hard to believe, as he knew that KOVALEV had been turned down for military service in 1966 because of nearsightedness. During the time that KOVALEV was in the Army, his wife told Source that where her husband was serving "they put army boots on once a month, just for show." KOVALEV's military service card (voyennyy bilet) nevertheless indicates both his 1966 rejection and the year that he supposedly spent in the Army.

5. Source believes that EPY's father-in-law was instrumental in his choice of a career and probably helped KOVALEV through his own connections. (Fnu MATVEYEV, the father-in-law, had once been an important KGB official in the Belorussian SSR.) Source also believes that KOVALEV, while he is an MVD officer, has close ties with the KGB and may have been co-opted by it. He bases this belief on KOVALEV's close and frequent association with Anatoliy AKSENOV, a KGB lieutenant (the subject of a separate report). The Yubileynaya, a hotel where foreigners stay, is apparently one of KOVALEV's assignments, as he is frequently seen there.

6. (Fnu) PINYAZ is the MVD officer who works with KOVALEV. Born in about 1945, PINYAZ is of average height and build, has short blond hair, gray eyes and dresses simply in an apparent effort to be inconspicuous. During a drinking session, PINYAZ admitted to Source that he cooperates closely with the KGB. PINYAZ is frequently seen at the Hotel Turist.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Organization, Functions, and Personalities of the MVD in Minsk

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in various jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76
DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

The headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) of the Belorussian SSR is on the corner of prospekt Lenina and ulitsa Uritskogo in Minsk. The Minister is General-leytenant KLIMOVSKIY. He is married and has two daughters, both of whom studied foreign languages at the Belorussian State University.

There is an MVD militia unit, called an internal affairs section (otdel vnutrennikh del, OVD), in each of the six rayons (precincts) of Minsk, as follows:

A. Frunze Rayon OVD, on Obuznaya ulitsa.

B. Tsentral'nyy Rayon OVD, on the corner of Respubli-kanskaya ulitsa and Komsomolskaya ulitsa.

C. Savet Rayon OVD, on Ploshchad' Ya.Kolasa.

D. Oktyabr' Rayon OVD.

E. Lenin Rayon OVD, at Serebryanka Mikro-rayon.

F. Zavod Rayon OVD, on Partizanskiy prospekt.

Each of these rayon OVDs (known as ROVD) consists of the following departments (otdeleniye):

A. Investigations Department (Sledstvennoye otdeleniye), the largest component of the ROVD, conducts investigations of all crimes committed within the boundaries of the rayon. According to Source, the best educated and most highly trained investigators and inspectors of the militia are to be found in this department. In the Frunze ROVD, Inspectors GLYDOVSKIY and Vladimir MELESHKO were friends of Source, who stated that both men have anti-Soviet leanings. An MVD major, Vladimir KOMAROVICH, investigates the most serious cases.

B. The Department for Combatting the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation (OBKhSS) is concerned with protecting socialist property in state establishments such as stores, plants and factories, hotels and restaurants. The following OBKhSS personalities were known to Source: (fnu) MALYSHKO and (fnu) POLYANSKIY in the Frunze ROVD, (fnu) KELLER and (fnu) VYSOTSKIY in the Tsentral'nyy ROVD, and (fnu) SUCHKOV in the Oktyabr ROVD.

C. Department for Combatting Parasitism (Otdel bor'by s tuneyadstvom). Source thought that the term "parasitism" (tunoyadstvo) had recently been removed from the USSR Criminal Code and replaced by "vagrancy, begging and other parasitic types of existence." But the official procedures remain the same. Citizens not engaged in socially productive labor are given a warning, which they must sign at the department. If they remain unemployed, their case is turned over to a court, and the offense is punishable by a sentence of up to two years. However, there are ways to get around the law. Source says that if it can be shown that parents or a spouse are providing support or if a person can get seasonal work, he can defend himself before the department. But most citizens are not aware of these loopholes, according to Source. After the Investigations Department, this militia department turns over the greatest number of citizens to the courts. Also, this department and the law that it enforces are frequently used against dissidents.

D. Passport Department. Employees of this department make entries in the internal passports of citizens regarding their place of residence, and this department therefore gets many visitors. The department also enforces passport regulations.

E. The Guards and Protection (Okhrana) Department is responsible for providing militia protection to special establishments, such as radio and television studios and stations. This department also provides escorts for prisoners and guards at trials.

F. Department of Burglar and Intrusion Alarms (Otdel vnevedomstvennoy okhrany OVO), Source did not have any information on this department except that he thought it provides guards and watchmen for various enterprises in addition to its work with alarm systems.

G. Motor Pool (Motodivizion) provides and maintains patrol cars and motorcycles for the militia.

The rayon OVDs (ROVDs) fall under the Minsk City Internal Affairs Directorate (Gorodskoye upravleniye vnutrennikh del, GUVD) of the Executive Committee of the Minsk City Soviet. (fnu) PISKAREV, who holds the rank of general-mayor of internal affairs, is chief of the Minsk GUVD. The GUVD, which is on Dobromyshlenskiy pereulok, houses the pretrial detention cell (kamera predvaritel'nogo zaklyucheniya, KPZ and OVIR). Even though the Minsk city OVIR falls under the Belorussian Republic OVIR, there is no republic-level OVIR office in Minsk, although there are some republic-level OVIR officials who sit in the MVD headquarters building on prospekt Lenina.

5. Shortly before Source left Minsk to emigrate, he learned of a very small section in the GUVD consisting of two people engaged in the surveillance of foreigners. Of particular interest to this section are the foreigners contacts with black marketeers (fartsovshchiki). Although Source previously thought that only the KGB was concerned with black marketeers, he concluded that the MVD is also involved and that the two organizations probably work closely together, both posting their representatives in the hotels where foreigners stay, such as the Turist, the Yubileynaya, and the Minsk. Source knew of two members of this small section, Vladimir KOVALEV and (fnu) PINYAZ (who are covered in a separate report).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Druzhinniki and Operativniki, Voluntary Militia Patrolmen

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76
DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. The druzhina is a group of civilians who volunteer to assist the militia in maintaining public order. Although the druzhiny originated spontaneously in about 1962, they have since become official appendages of the militia. There is at least one druzhina in each factory, public and commercial enterprise, institute and technical school. Although the druzhina officers are supposedly elected, they actually are appointed by the administration at the factory. A duty roster is posted. Almost everyone except the management has to be on duty at one time or another; no one can refuse. It is very hard to make people, especially the factory workers, roam the streets on druzhina duty after a day's work because they would rather go home.

2. In the institutes the druzhiny operate this way. After lectures all the students of a particular department have to attend a compulsory meeting. The senior druzhinnik of the institute is in charge of the meeting, together with the senior druzhinniki and deputies in the departments. Those students who for some reason did not manage to escape this duty (using a medical excuse, influence with the chief, or other means), are then marched to the nearest druzhina post. There are dozens of such posts in each rayon (precinct) of the militia, usually in the basements of apartment houses. Usually there is an officer of the militia there, with several militiamen of lower ranks.

At the druzhina post, each druzhinnik gets a red arm band to wear. Then, they are dispatched to different locations to patrol and uphold public order. What actually happens is that they just walk around the streets for a while, then return the red arm bands and go home. Not all of them, however, just walk around: for any number of reasons (desire to get ahead, anger at the world, or exercise of a little power) some of them grab off the streets either innocent people or obvious drunks and take them to the post. Source himself was taken in several times to such a post. There a militia officer fills out a report, and does not even try to listen to the detained person's explanation of what happened. If you do not try to prove your innocence, the matter will end just with a fine of five to ten rubles and a report to your place of work, which will cause you to lose any bonus pay. If you try to argue to prove your innocence, then the matter will get more serious. A patrol car that periodically visits each post, picks you up, and takes you to the rayon MVD. There, the militia holds you all day. In the best case, you have to pay a fine of ten rubles, and in the worst case, you receive fifteen days of confinement with compulsory labor, only if there was nothing criminal in your behavior. If there was, then you get a trial and a jail sentence.

If the druzhinniki do not bring anyone in, they are criticized for not doing their job conscientiously. Another reason for pressure on them, in Source's opinion, is that the government needs the money from the fines.

5. Some of the more active druzhinniki are offered jobs in militia after graduation.

6. Source heard about another organization, the operativniki, but he does not know the difference between them and the druzhinniki. It seems that the operativniki are a little higher in rank. They meet in secret, no one announces their meetings, or the names of the members. No one knows or talks about it.

7. In the Institute of Foreign Languages, the chief of the operativniki was Vladimir SHUMRIKOV, born 1939, about 186 cm tall, sturdily built, an athlete (former shotputter) who has short wavy hair, dark eyes, large features, and a fairly handsome but somewhat hard face. He graduated from INIYaz in 1973, speaks English and German, likes to drink, always hangs around the foreigners at the sport meets. SHUMRIKOV has been a Party member since 1973. Source saw him several times with Yevgeniy SURGATOV (KGB) in a Minsk bar. SHUMRIKOV also knows KGB senior lieutenant Anatoliy Alexsandrovich AKSENOV.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Selection and Recruitment of KGB Agents and Informers in the Belorussian SSR

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk, who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR born in 1949 he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides or his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-1976
DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. Source obtained most of the information in this report from Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV, a KGB senior lieutenant who was in charge of the KGB unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel in Minsk, and from friends and classmates who are now KGB and militia officers.

2. Source's curiosity about the selection and recruitment of KGB personnel was aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering the recruitment of Source as a KGB informant. Source asked AKSENOV who is selected and for what reasons. AKSENOV replied that the KGB usually uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Backgrounds were important. A person from a peasant or worker's family is a better choice, and he must either be a quiet and colorless type who blends into the circle of people in which he operates, or else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions. The latter would be more likely suspect of being a member of the opposition rather than a KGB informant. The average informant, according to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves are not particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who is smarter than they. Source says that he was never recruited.

3. Both Source and AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations of his friends in the name of patriotism will end up with dismal career prospects unless he has friends in high places. However, it is unlikely that such a person would be chosen for a KGB recruitment pitch in the first place. Therefore most of the lower levels of the KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being in the Army.

4. The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSR are also those who are not bright enough to make a career in some other field, such as science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons of high-ranking Party and government officials. This is why so many sons of Belorussian dignitaries work for the KGB. Otherwise they would be doomed to jobs which would pay 120 rubles per month for the rest of their lives, even if they could survive the competition in a profession in a city. In the KGB, an officer, who achieves success through a school, can look forward to steady promotion until he reaches the rank of major. And if his sponsor retains his influence, the officer of major can eventually be promoted to lieutenant colonel or even colonel before retiring. Also, it is a prestigious, interesting, and financially advantageous job which places the KGB officer above the common people to the point where many officers consider themselves to be above the law. Their salaries are often supplemented by discreet cooperation with black marketeers, who pay off either in goods or a percentage of the take. And there are the services of the women who sleep with foreigners, for money or for other considerations, and who report to the KGB. So a person like AKSENOV, responsible for a large tourist hotel like the Yubileynaya, actually presides over a small kingdom.

5. A KGB officer meets each of his agents (filer was the word used by Source) in a safe house (kvartira). Other officers are not supposed to know who the agents are, and this "conspiracy" is a matter of great pride to them. Source was once caught leaving the hotel room of a Bulgarian girl with whom he had spent the night, but he was released when he gave AKSENOV's name to the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying that Source was on assignment for AKSENOV).

6. Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming". For example, a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse to cooperate with the KGB because such refusal would mean that the person wouldn't be able to travel, as the KGB has a say about his final clearance. Source also gave the example of an applicant for an unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was originally turned down. But when AKSENOV spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the Symphony, the applicant was not only hired but received the greatest respect from the Symphony Director during the entire period of his employment.

7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavniki) because they are considered politically reliable and patriotic. Many otstavniki recruited by the KGB are former Osobyy otdel (Special Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions, reporting on or guarding specific areas.

8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend the "wrong" person. This means that the spotters are afraid to select clever people, so in the end they select mediocre ones. Selection is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer is a kolkhoznik, he is immediately 50% qualified. If he was in the Army, particularly in the Osobyy otdel, this adds another 30%. Other qualifications are based on the person's being "quiet", "average", or "ordinary".

The spotter is supposed to turn in a list of potential recruits and write a recommendation for each person. The prospective agent or informer is then called in and an offer to cooperate with the KGB is made. Source never heard anything about money being mentioned, but the KGB does offer help in the advancement of one's career. The assignments are very simple: The agent or informer just has to keep his eyes and ears open and to report anything that smacks of anti-government or illegal activity. Who can refuse such a call to patriotic vigilance? And if one does, he might well be classified as an enemy of the state and end up doing the lowliest physical labor rather than enjoying a promising career.

10. AKSENOV also told Source that the KGB usually opens a file on a Soviet citizen who corresponds with anyone abroad. After this, his telephone conversations are monitored and periodically recorded. And finally, KGB agents and informers who come into contact with him will be asked to report on him.

11. Source once asked AKSENOV what the KGB would consider its greatest accomplishment. AKSENOV replied that the discovery of a secret agent (nelegal) would be the first, followed by the discovery of an illegal printing press. Without printed matter a revolution cannot take place, according to AKSENOV. Third on the list is the discovery of the illegal possession of a rifled weapon, such as a rifle or pistol. This last item would not be considered particularly important in itself, but a KGB officer can do very well for himself if he plays his cards right. He must time the discovery of the illegal weapon with a public event involving an important Party dignitary. Thus, in the eyes of his superiors, his discovery is tantamount to thwarting an assassination attempt. Any one of the three accomplishments would lead to automatic promotion, a medal, and tenure for life in the KGB.

12. Traces: (SE/SAG/OP routinely uses the following sources in tracing: Soviet GICS, Soviet travel, IP Main Index, OCR and SE/SAG/OP branch index. These traces should not be construed as being extensive or complete and any recipients of this report with an active interest in any of the subjects should run full traces of their own.)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Keeping of Large Sums of Money in the Soviet Union

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-76
DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

Unless you have iron-clad proof that you got the money legally, the balance of your account in any one savings bank (sberkassa) should not exceed a thousand rubles. Each savings bank has a militia representative who reports suspiciously large accounts to the OBKhSS (Department for Combatting the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation) of the militia for investigation. Source got this information from a militia lieutenant who was an OBKhSS officer in his rayon.

2. Since savings banks do not have a centralized accounting system, another way of keeping large amounts of money is to have accounts in several banks, as long as none of them exceeds the thousand-ruble limit.

3. One of the best ways of keeping money when traveling, or even at home, is in the form of an akkreditiv (a personalized cashier's check). An akkreditiv can be bought at any bank or savings institution and can be cashed anywhere at any time but only by the person to whom it is made out and only on presentation of an internal passport. Without the passport, the akkreditiv cannot be cashed, thereby making it a safer form of keeping money than currency.

4. If money is to be kept at home, it is somewhat less suspicious to have it in the form of three-percent government loan bonds (trekhprotsentnyy zaem). These are not personalized and can be cashed at any time at a small discount. They also have the advantage of a prize that can be won at one of the periodic drawings based on their numbers.
