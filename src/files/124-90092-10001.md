SECRET

THOMPSON stated that this individual's face was somewhat familiar, and that the name definitely was familiar to him. THOMPSON identified this individual as a Captain HARVEY, whose name appeared on communications directed to OSI from the [7983rd Army Unit]. Specifically, THOMPSON remembered that Captain HARVEY's name had appeared on name check requests submitted to OSI Berlin, from the [7983rd Army Unit]. THOMPSON believed that the Soviets either showed THOMPSON a picture of HARVEY or asked THOMPSON about HARVEY. THOMPSON stated that he furnished whatever available information he had about HARVEY to the Soviets, but he could not now recall the nature of this information.
