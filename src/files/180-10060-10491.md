MEMORANDUM

June 15, 1977

TO: Tom Lambeth
Acting Staff Director
FROM: Donovan L. Gay
Chief Researcher
RE: Ms. Barbara L. Mosley

Please be advised that Ms. Barbara Mosley, resume attached, has been interviewed by Gerald Hamilton, Jackie Hess and myself for the position as secretary/typist assigned to the MLK Research Task Force.

Ms. Mosley certainly qualifies for this position, and we all agree that she is the mature individual for whom we are searching to fill this spot. She has been employed on Capitol Hill for some time and surely knows the many ins-and-outs.

I strongly recommend that Ms. Mosley be hired at $12,000 per annum and report for duty on Tuesday, June 21, 1977.

Tom, I certainly appreciate your consideration on this matter. Thank you.
