Dear Mr. Locke:

With reference to your letter of 26 September 1968
concerning Mr. Birch Dilworth O'Neal, I have known Mr. O'Neal
since the late 1940s. In 1950 we were establishing formal liaison
with the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization and, because
a thorough knowledge of the complex immigration laws was
essential, I proposed that this position should go to a lawyer.
Mr. O'Neal was selected and performed very well in that job,
which required constant liaison with this office on the legal
aspects.

In Mr. O'Neal's assignments since that time, I have
had occasion to work with him from time to time on a variety
of problems. I have found he has had a good grasp of the legal
aspects of these matters. From this long association my
conclusion is that Mr. O'Neal's moral character is good, he
has a sound background in the field of law, and is generally fit
for the practice of law.

Sincerely,

Lawrence R. Houston
General Counsel

RESUME
U. S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE
BIRCH D. O'NEAL

From January 10, 1938 on entering U. S. government service
as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to
February 28, 1970 (with exception of a few months in the fall
and winter of 1946-47) was employed by various Departments and
Agencies of the U. S. Government, including the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, U. S. Department of Justice, U. S. Department of
State, and Central Intelligence Agency. In this period of more
than 32 years steadily advanced in salary with commensurate
responsibilities from $3200 per annum to more than $30,000 per
annum while holding various titles including Special Agent,
Legal Attache, Civil Attache, and Foreign Affairs Officer.
More than 12 years of this service was performed while stationed
abroad or in travel status in many foreign countries of Latin
America, Europe and Africa.

While the entire service involved utilization of legal
training and conduct of investigations affecting the national
security interests of the United States, that from September

1942 to February 1970 (voluntary retirement) also involved
direct supervision of investigative and clerical assistants
(on occasions more than 50 employees and expenditure of
extensive funds). The service also involved extensive liaison
with foreign government and other U. S. government officials.
Liaison on occasions, both domestic and foreign, related to
matters of the highest sensitivity and importance and accordingly
was conducted at highest levels (Cabinet and sub-Cabinet).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

February 1947 - March 1947. In February 1947 I entered on
duty with what was known as the Central Intelligence Group,
2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C., a government body
created by Executive Order which was a predecessor to the
Central Intelligence Agency. I was a legal liaison officer
with this group.

March 1947 - December 1949. During this period I was
detailed to the U. S. Department of State, 20th Street and
Virginia Avenue N.W., Washington, D. C., where I was assigned
to the U. S. Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela, as Attache. In that
capacity I prepared reports and advised and counselled the U. S.
Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. In
this work I employed legal knowledge, background and experience
as related to the laws of the United States and the Republic
of Venezuela.

January 1950 to December 1951 - Central Intelligence
Agency, 2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. In this
period I was assigned to duties involving liaison on legal
matters with other departments of the U. S. Government in-
cluding the Department of Defense, Department of Justice
(Immigration and Naturalization Service and Federal Bureau
of Investigation) and the Department of State. Criteria
for the position included knowledge, application and
interpretation of U. S. and foreign laws. The establishment
of the position was at the instance of the General Counsel
of the Agency and my selection to the position was with his
concurrence. The assignment required close working coordination
and collaboration with the General Counsel of the Agency and
other governmental legal counsel. I discontinued this
particular work to enable me to again undertake further assign-
ment with the Department of State as a member of the Foreign
Service Staff Corps.

December 1951 - April 1954 - U. S. Department of State,
Foreign Service Staff, Washington, D. C. During this period
I served as Attache, Political Officer, American Embassy,
Guatemala City, Guatemala. In that capacity I gathered in-
formation concerning the legal system, laws, and enforcement
thereof and counselled and advised the U. S. Ambassador on
matters of a legal and political nature. In this work I
employed legal knowledge and experience as related to the
laws of the United States and the Republic of Guatemala. I
resigned from this position in Guatemala to return to the
U. S. for personal and family reasons.

I engaged in the general practice of law and served as assistant
to my father in the preparation of civil cases. My father is the

defendants in criminal cases in the City Court of
Bainbridge during a period in which my father's oldest
brother, Maston O'Neal, presently Congressman from
the Second District of Georgia was Solicitor Pro-Tem of that
Court. I represented defendants in criminal cases in the
Superior Court of Decatur County (Albany Judicial Circuit)
which was and is a Court of limited, general, jurisdiction.
Practice was both civil and criminal and included contracts,
torts, real and personal property law, title searches, etc.
I left this practice for the purpose of entering on duty with the
U. S. Department of Justice January 10, 1938 when I became

Requirements for admission to that service included having a
law degree and admission to a bar.

January 1938 - May 1942 - U. S. Dept. of Justice,

During this period I was engaged in gathering evidence, preparing
investigative reports and prosecutive summaries, assisting U. S.
Attorneys in preparation of cases for trial, and otherwise serving
the U. S. Department of Justice in its many and varied peacetime
and wartime responsibilities. This involved daily application
of legal knowledge and experience for which I had been educated
and trained and as required to the government position which
I held; I served in field offices at Albany,
Tennessee, Charlotte, North Carolina, New York,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Birch D. O'Neal,
CI Staff

SUBJECT: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability
System

1. I have your memorandum of 27 October 1966 which refers to my
memorandum advising you that in the initial screening of personnel eligible
to become participants in the CIA Retirement System you have been deter-
mined to be ineligible because of an apparent deficiency in "qualifying duty."
It is important that you realize that such a deficiency is only significant in
the initial review of Agency personnel who have 15 or more years of Agency
service since the law permits such persons to acquire at their option a
vested interest in the CIA Retirement System. At the same time, the law
requires a minimum of 60 months qualifying duty before one can possibly
qualify for retirement benefits under the CIA Retirement System. It serves
no purpose, therefore, to place a person permanently in the System if there
is a possibility that he may never qualify for benefits therein.

2. In paragraph 2 of your memorandum you indicate concern that failure
to contest the initial findings in your case may prejudice the possibility of a
favorable decision with regard to your eligibility to participate in the CIA
Retirement System at some future date. It is assumed that you were referring
to the possibility that you may have some additional service that could perhaps
