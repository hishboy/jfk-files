b. Operation Virgen del Cobre. Designed to exploit the 8 September anniversary of the Cuban patron saint as a day of mourning expressing opposition to Castro's attacks upon the church, religious freedom, and Cuban freedom. Progress: All local and western Hemisphere assets alerted for the 8 September campaign. Sixty-five thousand pieces of propaganda were distributed for mailing throughout Latin America. The Cruzada Feminina Cubana (CFC) women's group sent eight cables and 130 letters in the Latin American area. Through the joint efforts of the CFC and Catholics, mass and benediction services were held before 25,000 people in the Miami stadium. It was said to be a huge success.

Headquarters representative met with Rojas Santamarina, and discussed his plan for PRAIFTON project, i.e., establishment of phantom cells inside Cuba through medium of propaganda chain letters. Headquarters is studying the idea with a view to possible trial-run on a small scale.

C. Political Action Activity

1. CRC. A meeting was held 9 September with Dr. Miro Cardona at which time he was advised by higher authority that our Government regards the CRC as the control point of contact in its dealing with the Cuban exile and underground activity. A basic administrative budget will be allocated, and it will be in the neighborhood of a million dollars per year. All other allocations of money will be on the basis of specific projects submitted by the Council and approved by the United States. The Cuban Council will continue to broaden its base allowing entry of all substantial exile groups not identified with Batista or with Communism. Groups not willing to work with the Council will be dealt with bilaterally (the United States and the group involved), but Dr. Miro will be kept informed of these activities. Such information will be kept in the strictest secrecy by Dr. Miro and his specially appointed assistant. If this arrangement should prove insecure, such contacts will terminate. All problems arising from Council activities will be discussed between the CRC and the Bureau of AA of State Department. Dr. Miro will maintain his contact with the White House for cases wherein he considers such contact to be urgently necessary.

2. Additional Political Developments. After high level United States consideration and decision, Dr. Miro was informed, at a meeting on 16 September, that the responsibility for the organization and plans for exile Cuban jurists and Lawyers would be his. In addition, to his future funding "salaries" of the existing ALASAU organization, $5,000 per month would be provided Dr. Miro or his designee retroactive to 1 August to support Dr. Miro's faction of lawyers to whom he has a long outstanding commitment. It was emphasized that this transfer of responsibility must be accomplished harmoniously, without adverse press reaction, or support of this work would be withdrawn. Col. Wendell Johnson was hired and will be placed in contact with Dr. Miro prior to 1 October. He will function as the day-to-day contact between Dr. Miro and this Agency and the United States Government. It was made clear to Dr. Miro that his demand for responsibility as exclusive channel to the other professional groups, i.e., students and labor, was rejected. He was told that any proposals he might wish to make in the student and labor fields would be welcomed as promoting harmony and eventual unity of Cuban exile anti-Castro elements.

D. Paramilitary Activity

1. Maritime Activity

The principal activity during the period revolved around preparation and support of operation TEABAD, to be implemented 16 September.

b. The LCI, BARBARA-J, is now awaiting additional engineering and electrical work at the Jan Juan Drydock Company. Delay has been caused by the lack of priority and the induction of several Navy ships requiring urgent repairs.
