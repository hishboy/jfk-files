MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Compromise of Cover

1. As a result of information obtained from reliable sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that the former Staff personnel listed on the attachment should be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employees to the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975. We presume also that the identifications of these individuals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese to the Soviets.

2. Although the personnel listed in the attachment are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest that their official personnel records should be documented concerning the possible past compromise of their cover.

3. Please coordinate any action connected with this memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMG; and Chief, CI Staff.

Ron -

Conein was in U. S. military from September 1941 through September 1961, and on detail to OSS, SSU, CIG, and CIA to time of military retirement.

He was picked up as a civilian and as a career agent on 12 November 1961 and retired on disability on 15 July 1968.

Archenhold advised that subject claims military service as indicated above and that the only period to be certified is the period as a civilian, November '61 to July '68. This all we know about what Conein told DEA.

Remarks:

Luke Conein has applied for employment

with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The

Acting D/Pers asked for the attached info

from CIA.

Sent to D/Pers for signature. Conein

was very controversial, much in the news

about the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem and

has been mentioned by Howard Hunt in Hunt's

recent hearing before "Watergate" committed.

Dick Biladeau, Central Cover, affirms that

Conein is "opened up".

Ben -

Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached memorandum is what Archenhold wants.

Conein's service was verified with ROB; his "honorable service" was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I discussed the case with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had opened up Conein last year and Biladeau approved release of the information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Department investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being considered as a consultant for BNDD.

Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.
