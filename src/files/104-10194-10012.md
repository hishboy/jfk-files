2 January 1974

MEMORANDUM FOR: J. Walton Moore

THROUGH : Head of Career Service

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their even-
tual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each
employee well in advance of the date he is scheduled for retire-
ment. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise you
that you are scheduled to retire on 5 October 1979.

2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves
serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the
transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence.
To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the near future, be invited by the Retirement Counselor
for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling
session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement
planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation
and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on
such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits,
life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation
and movement of household effects and assistance in obtaining
other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a
Retirement Information Seminar that will be offered in the
autumn of 1974.

3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the
scheduled date and who wish to commence their planning as early
as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well
before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe
you would benefit from such an earlier start on your personal
planning, you are entitled to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate at the Retirement Affairs Division,
212 Magazine Building, on telephone extension 3328.

SUBJECT: Retirement Planning

4. Experience has amply demonstrated that careful planning
facilitates the transition to retirement. I recommend, strongly,
that you avail yourself of the services the Agency offers you in
planning your own retirement.

5. It is requested that you indicate receipt of this memo-
randum by signing below. The original of this memorandum, should
be returned to Retirement Affairs Division, Retirement Operations
Branch, Room 205, Magazine Building, as soon as possible.
