C/S COMMENT: RE EXFILTRATION OF ANFAUNA-25 FROM CUBA.

BELIEVE IT CURRENTLY APPROPRIATE REVIEW MFALINA-05 SITUATION WITHIN FRAMEWORK THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE REF. FORWARDED. SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE:

WAVE ACTION RESULTED EXFILTRATION AMFAUNA-14 AND THUS DIRECT THREAT SECURITY ARFAUNA-35, AMFAUNA-39. (ALVAREZ MON AND EDUARDO VEGA HAS BEEN ELIMINATED)

INITIAL DEBRIEFING AUFAUNA-14 REVEALS THESE AGENTS NOT KNOWN DSE. WILL ATTEMPT CONFIRM THIS INITIAL DEBRIEFING CONCLUSION VIA FLUTTER EXAM. IT APPEARS HOWEVER THAT OUR REMEDIAL ACTION HAS NOT ONLY AVERTED POSSIBLE FLAP BUT HAS KEPT VIABLE ASSETS IN PLACE.

WAVE ATTEMPTS EXFIL ANCUTLER-2 WERE NOT PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE ANCUTLER-2 REFUSED LEAVE CUBA WHEN WE OFFERED HE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THIS DUE FACT HER MOTHER SERIOUSLY ILL.

REMOVAL ARCUTLER-2 FROM CUBA STILL REMAINS PRIORITY TASK AS MTFAUNA-14 DEBRIEFING CONFIRMS WAVE'S ANALYSIS THAT ACUTLER-2 IS PRIME CANDIDATE FOR IMMEDIATE ARREST. HER ARREST WOULD LEAD TO ARREST ARFAUNA'S 10, 15, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37 AND 38.

EFFORT AVOID THIS TYPE FLAP IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. THIS EFFORT HOWEVER CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF WE ACT IN TIMELY AND IMAGINATIVE MANNER. IT WAVE OPINION THIS IS NOT TIME AWAIT DEVELOPMENTS WITH STOICISM BUT IT IS TIME INFLUENCE DEVELOPMENTS VIA SOUND ACTION.

THUS DESPITE ANCUTLER-2 INITIAL REFUSAL LEAVE CUBA PROPOSE CONTINUE ATTEMPTS EXFIL ALTHOUGH THIS PROBLEM CURRENTLY COMPLICATED BY FACTS WAVE NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH ANCUTLER-2 AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE SHE LOCATED AS SHE HAS GONE INTO HIDING AND WAS CUT TIES WITH NORMAL COMMO CHANNELS.

WAVE TRYING IDENTIFY A-2 HIDING PLACE IN ORDER MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT EXFIL HER BUT THIS TIME ASSUMING FRUSTRATING EFFORT WHICH HOLDS NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS. SUGGEST THEREFORE FATE OTHER ANFAUNA ASSETS CANNOT BE ALLOWED DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS SINGLE EFFORT. HAVE THEREFORE REVIEWED EACH ANFAUNA ASSET WHO WOULD BE COMPROMISED BY ARREST ANCUTLER-2 AND HAVE CONSIDERED HOW WE COULD ATTEMPT SAVE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED.

WITHIN CONTEXT OVER-ALL REVIEW BELIEVE FOLLOWING FACTOR ARE GERMANE TO ANFAUNA-25 SITUATION.

THERE NO DIRECT SECURE COMMO BETWEEN WAVE AND ARFAUNA-25 THIS TIME. COMMO LINK WAS ANCUTLER-2 TO AMFAUNA-27 TO AFFAUNA-25.

ANCUTLER-2 OUT OF TOUCH THERE NO REPEAT NO WAY SECURELY FIND OUT DETAILS A-25 CURRENT SITUATION OR TO COMMUNICATE WITH WAVE.

CUBA HAS STATE-CONTROLLED ECONOMY AND A-25 EMPLOYED INSURANCE. ORIGINAL SPICE CAN FINANCE MINISTRY THIS HE CAN

TRAVEL ABROAD
GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

CURRENCY SHORTAGE NOT LIKELY DETER A-25 TRAVEL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH REQUIRES

A-25 HAS NO KNOWN RELATIVES OR FRIENDS OUTSIDE CUBA WHO COULD FIND HIS TRAVEL ABROAD THUS IT UNREALISTIC ASSUME A-25 COULD HIMSELF ARRANGE LEGAL DEPARTURE CUBA. A-25 MUST BE HELPED IN ARRANGING LEGAL DEPARTURE AND THIS HELP CAN ONLY COME FROM RUDARA. DO NOT KNOW IF THIS HELP WILL BE EFFECTIVE BUT BELIEVE IT MUST BE OFFERED IF WE MUST ATTEMPT ARRANGE EXPENSES PAID INVITATION FOR A-25 VISIT LONDON TO DISCUSS CUBAN INSURANCE PROBLEMS WITH MINET CO LONDON. LEAD TIME INVOLVED ARRANGING SUCH TRAVEL QUITE LENGTHY AND IF THIS APPROACH IS TO HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR SUCCESS IT MUST BE INITIATED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. BELIEVE THIS TRAVEL CAN ONLY BE LAID ON WITH Y KNOWLEDGE AND CONCURRENCE.

SEE NO HARM PER SE IN DISCUSSING A-25 EXFIL OP WITH SNOTH THEY WILL SAY YES OR NO. IF ANSWER IS NO WE HAVE HONESTLY AND IN GOOD CONSCIENCE EXHAUSTED ALL LEGAL MEANS ARRANGE A-25 EXFIL IF ANSWER IS YES (CITY) WILL HAVE WITTINGLY AGREED ASSIST IN OP AND WILL BE MADE PITFALLS IF ANY WHICH COULD CREATE EMBARRASSMENT. THIS POINT WAVE SEES NO FLAP POTENTIAL IN LEGAL EXFIL.

ONCE A-25 ARRIVES LONDON HE WOULD BE DEBRIEFED IN CETATE IN ATTEMPT LADY QIRA DO KNOWLEDGEABILITY, THIS EFFORT SHOULD PRODUCE INTERESTING INTEL AS A-25 OBVIOUSLY KNOWLEDGEABLE RE CUBAN FINANCE MINISTRY.

IN TEST PAGE

IN SILI OFFICER AND CIS COLLABORATOR WHO FURNISHES COVER FOR ONE OR MORE CIS STAFF EMPLOYEES HAVANA AND IS TARGETTED BY CIS AGAINST BRITISH CANADIAN EMBASSIES HAVANA. THESE FACTORS PLUS A-25 CLOSE ASSOCIATION CHE GUEVARA SHOULD PRODUCE THE INFO FROM OND DEBRIEFING WHICH WOULD GIVE KUBARK CURRENT INSIGHT INTO SEVERAL AREAS WHERE TOP LEVEL INTEL LACKING. RECOGNIZING FACT THAT A-25 IS OPPORTUNIST SEE NO REASON BELIEVES HE WOULD NOT FURNISH THIS INFO ONCE HE MADE AWARE OF REALITIES WHICH COULD AFFECT HIS SECURITY IF ACUTLER-2 ARRESTED.

PRIOR A-25 COMES LONDON AND ARCHITLER-2 EXFIL ARRANGE EXPIRATION A-25 'S TRAVEL TIME THEN SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN TO KEEPING A-25 IN 76405

BELIEVE THERE NO QUESTION BUT THAT IF WE HAD A CONTROLLED AGENT WITH ACCESS COMMO CHANNEL, COULD BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING ASSET DUE HIS POSITION AND IMPLIED INTEL ACCESS AS OUTLINED PARA 2-0. IN THIS SITUATION TIME EFFORT EXPENDED BRINGING A-25 LONDON WOULD BE SOUND INVESTMENT AS IT SHOULD CLARIFY A-25 BONA FIDES AND IF HE BONA FIDE WOULD ENABLE US SEND TRAINED AGENT BACK TO TARGET AREA WITH COMMO THERE CURRENTLY. WITH SECURITY FACTORS MITIGATING AGAINST THIS ONCE ANCUTLER-2 OUT OF CUBA.

VIEW ABOVE RECOMMENDATIONS EXPEDITE POA FOR PETER MINET LONDON DISCUSS A-25 TRAVEL TO BRITAIN WITH (SAUIN) OF IF THIS DISCUSSION FAVORABLE THEN LONDON SHOULD

RAISED RECRUIT (MINET) AND HAVE HIM ATTEMPT ARRANGE A-25 TRAVEL. HIGH REPEAT THAT SPEED IN HANDLING THIS PROPOSAL IS ESSENTIAL BUT IS CRITICAL FACTOR FOR FAILURE OF THIS FANEU TENDS.

PLS ADVISE
