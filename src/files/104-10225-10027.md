KNOWLEDGE OF CHILE AND ABILITY USE HIS BACKGROUND FOR SPECULATION ON

UNION'S ACCEPTANCE OF CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY JUNTA WHEREBY THE SOVIET
UNION MUST FREE AN EQUAL NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AS FREED BY
CHILE. WHEN BRUNO DOPPLER, INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVE
IN CHILE WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT FELDMEYER'S MISSION, HE DENIED THAT HE
WAS ON THAT TYPE OF MISSION. BUT LATER WHEN ASKED WHETHER IT WAS
TRUE THAT FELDMEYER CARRIED WITH HIM THE SOVIET ACCEPTANCE, HE
ANSWERED, "THERE IS NO CONFIRMATION. IT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
THE CHILEAN AUTHORITIES ARE THE ONES TO CONFIRM IT." Y

WITH "UNTIL NOW, NO APPARENT RESPONSE." ALSO ADDS LUIS CORVALEN
LEADS THE KREMLIN LIST.
2. APART FROM NEW DIMENSION ADDED TO REF PROPOSALS BY
ABOVE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL (AI) COULD BE
INDUCED TO TAKE UP ISSUE. AS NOTED REF AT HAS VERY PRESCRIBED
APPROACHES AND TECHNIQUES WHICH IT USES TO HANDLE, VIA A CHAIN
OF (DIVIDUAL SPONSERSE, INDIVIDUAL CASES, WHILE THEY MAY
OCCASIONALLY USE PUBLICITY IF ALL ELSE FAILS THEY BASICALLY REGARD
IT AS A DISTINCT INHIBITION TO THE SUCCESS OF THEIR BEHIND THE
SCENES PERSON TO PERSON TECHNIQUE. AI'S POSITION ON THE CHILEAN
CHALLENGE WOULD PROBABLY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED BY ITS
HAVING ONLY VERY RECENTLY ACCEPTED A MOSCOW CHAPTER DESPITE THE
STRONG OBJECTIONS OF SOME OF ITS KEY LEADERS. SINCE OUR ASSETS
WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN FORCING THIS ISSUE THEY ARE NOT IN A
SECURE POSITION TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS ONE ESPECIALLY GIVEN
THE EXTREME UNPOPULARITY OF THE OVERALL CHILE STORY.
3. WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE ALERT TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME
FORM OF MEDIA PLACEMENTS TO ACCOMPLISH REF GOALS BUT WE HAVE
TO ESTIMATE THAT CHANCES OF ANY OF OUR ASSETS BEING ABLE TO

1. INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF CHILEAN JUNTA AND MORE RECENTLY OF
BKHERALD HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED TO DRAMATIC PROPORTIONS. HQS BELIEVES
EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A
NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR
CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE
USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING
POLITICAL PRISONERS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF
ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF
POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT
THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD
DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. Y
2. THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO
NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION,
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH
A NEUTRAL SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS
SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE OFFER TO RELEASE IMPORTANT CHILEAN

COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST LEADERS. WHATEVER THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THE
OTHER HALF OF THE EXCHANGE. LEFTISTS OF NUMEROUS SHADES INCLUDING
THE BERTRAND RUSSELL GROUPS SHOULD ALSO FAVOR THE RELEASE OF THESE
PRISONERS, YET BE LESS TROUBLED BY THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SOVIETS
AND CUBANS. SECOND, THE OFFER IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROUPS LIKE
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL TO BRING DIRECT PRESURE ON THE USSR TO RELEASE
SOME PROMINENT INTELLECTUAL PRISONERS. FINALLY, THE OFFER SHOULD
ATTRACT SOME HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO FAVOR RELEASE OF ALL
POLITICAL PRISONERS ON PRINCIPLE. IN FACT, PROPERLY DEVELOPED, THE
EXCHANGE IS POTENTIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO ALMOST THE ENTIRE POLITICAL
SPECTRUM. Y
3. SUGGEST ROME APPROACH DEFLOWER TO SEE WHETHER HE CAN GET HIS
GROUP INTERESTED IN TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS TO GET PRISONERS RELEASED
ON EXCHANGE BASIS FROM CHILEAN JUNTA. PERHAPS IF HE CAN PICTURE HIMSELF AS SAVING THE
PRISONERS (COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST LEADERS IN CHILE AND IMPORTANT
INTELLECTUALS IN THE USSR) FROM A ENFASCIST REGIME ON THE ONE BHAND
AND FROM A STALINIST COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HE CAN BECOME SUFFICIENTLY
INTERESTED IN PURSUING THE EXCHANGE. OBJECTIVE WOULD BE HAVE
