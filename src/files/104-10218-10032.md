ADULALICK TUK PRESENTATION SU KUGLEIC
A.
MUUDELION
Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV: He is a 38-year-old officer of
the KGB who occupies the cover position of Second Secretary. He
first visited Mexico in 1959 for a Soviet Industrial Exposition
and later came from September 1961 until August 1965. He
returned again in September 1968 to replace another KGB officer.

KOSTIKOV is considered to be one of the most effective and dan-
gerous of the intelligence officers in Mexico. He has had a
wide range of responsibilities which have included operations
among emigre groups in western Mexico, operations directed
against the United States and currently against the governments
of Central America. He presently meets with exiles from Guate-
mala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras. He is known to have
passed funds to these groups as well as tactical guidance.
