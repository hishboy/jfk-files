Talked to him Collis, Deputy Chief, Ground Photo Services Branch, in the absence of Harry Van Tuyl. There is no photo of 3 bums in police custody at the scene of the assassination. Without a credit at the bottom of the photo it cannot be obtained from the wire service directly.

Mr. Collis called Serb Simmons CRS, Document Services Group could arrange umax in New York (who has State, color) to put in a request to Newsweek.

Simmons said he could not make a request for a domestic photo without the authorization of Dr. Proctor, but even authorization does not recommend this route as there is no plausible legal reason for a "State" person to be requesting this photo.
