DATE: 29 June 1954

SUBJECT: GENERAL - Operational
SPECIFIC - Subject of FM-N-1507

REFERENCE: FM-N-1507, 16 June 1954

TWWW-975

1. Subject is contacted by a member of this Mission about twice a month usually on a semi-social basis. Subject is quite familiar with the workings of [redacted] based on his experience in Panama, his frequent visits there, and his contacts with this office during the past [redacted]. From time to time subject provides bits of information or opinions on local affairs which he thinks may be of interest. Ways in which he could be of further operational use have also been discussed with him in general terms. Subject has provided his name for use in registering a station automobile and for obtaining post office boxes.

2. Subject appears to be well versed in some of the operational methods of the organization and has always expressed a willingness to assist in any way possible. This might include acting as a cut-out, furnishing general political and Communist information, setting up cover establishments, and the development of informants in several fields. To date, no specific opening for his services has been evolved but it is highly likely that such a spot will appear in the future.

3. This Mission foresees no strong obstacle or reason against subject's being contacted by KUJUMP again but feels that if subject had any information of possible interest to this organization he would immediately contact the writer. In addition, such a contact might possibly re-kindle subject's previously expressed feeling that at times it appeared that "the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing". It is suggested that if KUJUMP has any specific type of information in mind, questions indicating the line of interest could be forwarded to this Mission and placed before subject for his comment. If KUJUMP particularly desires to interview subject it is suggested that this Mission be authorized to so inform subject so that the matter will appear completely coordinated in subject's mind.

1. A representative of AT recently contacted subject, a U.S. manufacturers' representative, who lives in Mexico City. After [redacted] made its standard explanation of KUBARK interests, the subject said that he felt that he should make it clear that he worked for [redacted] in Mexico. He qualified this by saying [redacted] was extensive background and experience in Mexico enabled him to set up meeting places and front offices as well as other cover projects for KUBARK, NDACIO and VI.

2. Subject seemed quite candid and [redacted] had no reason to believe that he was not telling the truth. Subject doubted that he could give KUBARK a great deal of information which was not available through official agencies operating in Mexico. However, he seems to be generally knowledgeable on the situation there and [redacted] feels that he is be a source of some interesting information if their contacting him would not interfere with arrangements which your Mission might have made with him.

3. Headquarters requests comments regarding subject. Please advise as soon as possible, since [redacted] would like to contact subject again when he returns to this country in July.

1. A representative of this Division recently contacted subject, a US manufacturers' representative, who lives in Mexico City. Wichtrich was visiting representatives of the Nehi Corporation which is one of his accounts in Mexico City. After our representative made his standard explanation of agency interests, Wichtrich said that he felt that he should make it clear that he worked for the Agency in Mexico. He qualified this statement by saying that his extensive background and experience in Mexico enabled him to set up meeting places and "front" offices as well as other "cover" projects for this Agency, the State Department and the Bureau.

2. He seemed quite candid and our representative had no reason to believe that he was not telling the truth. Wichtrich countered that he could give us a great deal of information which was not available through official agencies operating in Mexico. However, he seems to be generally knowledgeable on the situation there and we believe that he might be a source of some interesting information if our contacting him would not interfere with arrangements which the covert offices might have made with him.

3. We should appreciate your comments. If you prefer, we shall not see him again. On the other hand, if you have no objection, we should like to contact him when he returns to this country in July. Please advise.

DISPATCH NO. TMM-0976

1. Subject was engaged by our field station, Panama, in October 1947 with the thought that he was qualified to organize a net directed against a target of high priority interest. His services were terminated in April 1949 when he took residence in Mexico for business purposes.

2. The Chief of Station, Panama, considered this man as having great singleness of purpose which produces results in the field of his primary interest. But the experience in [redacted] revealed that the subject's primary interest - his business - was such that he had little time to work as an agent.

3. The Subject organized an intelligence net for the U.S. Army in China during World War II and therefore understands covert operations. Despite his capabilities, proven ability, and his expressed desire to be of service in [redacted] does not recommend that the subject be engaged by field station, [redacted], unless there is unusual need for a man of his background.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

COUNTRY: YAWNER PERIOD COVERED: October 1945 - March 1949

1. Subject is no longer an active operative of this station. He was forced to discontinue his activities on our behalf because of the press of personal business. [Redacted] is now in contact with ACID and HYDROL [redacted] has been taken over by OPHOLIC.

2. During the period of his connection with this station, [redacted] failed to submit any informational report which in itself merited transmission to the Home Office. None of his operations were clean in the sense that a U.S. Government influence had to be introduced into the actual activation of each of his sources. This coupled with the fact that he lacked follow-through has given a slightly sour aspect to all of his operations. We intend to discontinue our connections with Subject.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

COUNTRY: YAWNER PERIOD COVERED: 20 October, 1947 to present.

OBJECTIVES AND Subject's original assignment was the estab-

TASKS: lishment of an intelligence net for the Republic of Panama with a view to developing information on our various YAWNER objectives. The assignment was too broad because subject is establishing a new business and has not had sufficient time to devote to our work. His activities were redirected along the lines of cultivation of specific individuals. His cultivation and recruitment of the informant HYDRACID was excellent. His handling of the subject of TZF-A-360 was excellent. His handling of HYDRAMANIAC has been unsatisfactory in that he has not spent sufficient time on the project. He states he will correct this deficiency. His latest assignment is the penetration of communist circles in the National University of Panama. He has recruited an excellent individual for this purpose who will be employed at a salary of one Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per month. This project is approximately one year old.

SALARY To date subject has not received a salary, but has been compensated socially and by

making purchases for him in the government commissaries. We plan to place him on a salary status in the future. When this is done we intend that his salary be One Hundred Dollars per month ($100.00) per month. He no longer has cover in his activities as concerns the U.S. Army in this area. This is due to the fact that [redacted] attempted to recruit him as an army informant after subject had performed two week's active duty with Army Intelligence. To avoid refusing the General's request, subject informed him that he was processing his information through LINE. Since that date, [redacted] men have called at subject's place of business inquiring for information. However, we seem to have his real loyalty and we are the ones who can provide him with funds to cultivate sub-agents.

As stated above subject has performed excellent services but has not devoted a great deal of time to our work. His interest has greatly increased since you permitted HYDROL to receive home office training. He has fairly good contacts and is capable of cultivating almost anyone we might wish. His services should become more valuable in the immediate future.

To date subject's intelligence information has only been valuable as a supplement to other sources. His operational information has been excellent and is of real value. He is more interested in the operational side of our activities than in reporting.

This agent has been handled as outlined in T2F-151 subject to the modifications of increased social contacts necessitated by the fact that subject's wife is interested in the social advantages to be gained from her husband's activities.

We plan to continue using this agent to cultivate other potential agent personnel. His primary continuous project will now be the penetration of communist activities in the National University of Panama. He may rearrange the relationship between HYDROL;

REQUEST:

HYDRACID and in view of HYDRACID's current schooling. This project is still in the development or probationary stage in that HYDROL's background is such that he regards the sky as the limit in the expenditure of Intelligence Funds and is inclined to commit himself financially without real assurance that we will receive full value for the funds expended. Realizing that time is an important factor in the development of high level operations we hope this will prove to be the most efficient expenditure of our funds. If not we will convert the funds to other projects. As a matter of operational organization we feel our ultimate objective in this area should be to ferret out and operate with a minimum number of skilled American resident agents. Offsetting the criticism mentioned above are the facts that subject [redacted] and definitely a high level operative.

It is requested that Project HYDROL be approved to permit an expenditure of Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) per quarter.

Interview with Alfonso Rudolf Wichtrich by Paul P. Parton

1. On 17 November 1948, the subject called at [redacted] Building and was interviewed by Paul P. Paxton. He had been advised to pay his respects to Harry A. Real by the Chief of Station, Panama City. The subject [redacted] to learn what the procedure would be if he wished to offer his services with CIA at a future date. At the present time he is managing the Royal Crown Bottling Works in Panama City and is negotiating for a franchise to distribute a milk product in that area. His primary purpose in coming to the United States at this time was to make arrangements for this latter business venture. The subject has been aiding the Chief of Station in Panama for the past year in a manner that has been extremely helpful to our operations. During the war he was a Lt. Col. in United States Army Intelligence serving for a considerable time in China in an undercover capacity. He gives evidence of being very well versed in intelligence matters and shows keen appreciation for security matters.

2. He stated that within six or eight months his private business affairs in Panama would be developed to the point where he could accept a position with this Agency in a full-time capacity. He evidenced interest in either the Latin American area or in the [redacted] China. [Redacted] made no commitments as far as future employment is concerned but I did suggest that [redacted] visit this headquarters on his next visit to the United States providing he is in a position to accept full-time employment. I recommend that his application be given serious consideration in the light of his past intelligence experience and by virtue of his valuable assistance to our operations in Panama.

BIOGRAPHICAL DATA

1. HYDROL.

2. Subject's background has been with the U. S. Army in China, where he organized a complete intelligence net. He is an organizer and planner and best qualified for the supervision of intelligence nets and informants, and intelligence operations in general.

3. He is a very personable individual and has the facility for getting along with Latins. He is very well accepted even though he has been here only a little over a year.

4. [Redacted] In Latin America because of his knowledge of Spanish. He is also well qualified to operate in the China Theater in view of his past experiences, although he has no knowledge of the language.

5. Subject makes frequent business trips to Mexico.

6. Subject has discussed plans for expanding his business into South America.

7. Subject has five people working for him. (a) HYDRACID; HYDRAMANIAC; and the subject of TZP-A-269. He has also cultivated two unwitting informants, one of whom is a fairly prominent Arnulfista and the other is a socially prominent Panamanian and businessman on whom we will submit biographical data at a future date. (b) None of the people are paid. The subject of TZF-A-269 has been informed that we will defray any expenses which he may have incidental to our operations. HYDRACID has expressed a desire to have a savings or retirement fund opened for him in the United States. This we have agreed to do and estimate that the cost will be about $100 to $150 per month.

8. [Redacted]

9. In view of the fact that subject contacted the Home Office prior to his departure from the United States, he is thoroughly cognizant of the ultimate destination of his information.

10. Yes. In view of HYDROL's experience in the intelligence field he has been given the assignment of supervising and controlling the activities of HYDRACID who has an excellent knowledge of the local situation but lacks experience as an intelligence operative. This also serves to maintain HYDRACID's cover.

11. Through letter drop. In addition frequent personal contacts take place between HYDROL and the Chief of Station. These are usually at night at the homes of the individuals concerned. Cover is provided in that the Chief of Station and HYDROL both have children attending the same school and the wives are acquainted socially.

12. Subject usually reports orally, accompanying his oral reports with brief notes. He is training the subject of TZF-A-269 and HYDRACID to report in writing.

13. During the 1½ years subject has been in Panama, he has been principally concerned with establishing his own business. He has devoted only a small percentage of his time to our work to date, however, since he is now better established and better oriented, it is contemplated that he will become more active.

14. Contract with subject is oral. A written contract will be prepared at the time he is placed on our payroll.

15. Yes. He is attempting a high-level penetration of the Partido del Pueblo. At the present time, a foreign national who has been approached by HYDRACID is attempting to buy one of the Directors of the Partido del Pueblo.

16. Subject is quite capable of using his own judgment on the sort of work he is to do. Since his time has been limited in the past, he has confined his activities to projects specifically requested by this Station.

PAYMENT

17. Subject is a volunteer informant who is rewarded for his services by the occasional presentation of exchange commodities. Since subject does not have U. S. Government Commissary privileges, purchases on his behalf are made by the Station. This results in approximately 60% reduction in the cost of necessities purchased in this manner.

18. Yes. Salary arrangements have been discussed between HYDROL and the Chief of Station. He both agree that no salary should be paid until such time as he becomes more productive. It is contemplated that when we actually

201 30999

SECRET

start payment the figure will be something less than $150.00 a month and it will probably be placed into some sort of a savings account. This plan may be placed into effect at any time.

19. Subject has been informed that we will defray all expenses incurred by him on our behalf.

20. No cost of purchase of information is involved but he is authorized to engage in this practice.

EVALUATION OF SUBJECT'S WORK

21. Subject appears to be a highly dependent individual. (a) The accuracy of his reports have been good. (b) From a security angle he is excellent.

22. In view of subject's previous intelligence background, it is believed he is only suitable for semi-covert work.

23. Subject is unquestionably a high-level operative and quite possibly might penetrate any of the local social or government circles, but again his background from China is such that it would probably be impossible for him to accomplish a penetration of any leftist organizations or foreign intelligence agencies.

CONFIDENTIAL

MICHTRICH, Alfonso Rudolph

4 December 1947

On December 3, 1947 the investigative files of Confidential Government Agency (L-2) were examined and disclosed the following:

Included in the file is an Investigative report dated June 25, 1943 regarding one Captain Al. R. Wichtrich, my Serial Number 0377220, which revealed no adverse information regarding Subject. It was mentioned, however, by four informants that Subject's father was suspected of having pro-German leanings during World War #1, but these suspicions were not verified by the informants. Persons interviewed vouched for Subject's father's loyalty at the time of the investigation.

It was noted that Subject's Personal History Statement dated February 16, 1943 indicates that he was born on October 30, 191 [redacted]. The investigation verified the fact, however, that Subject was born in Chihuahua, Mexico on October 30, 1915.

In a casual conversation with another officer, Subject volunteered the following information with respect to records of his birthplace. Subject stated that he had no birth certificate and had moved from Chihuahua Mexico to El Paso, Texas, with his parents, when he was one or two years of age.
