2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

3/8/61

To: Mr. Jack Kennedy
WH/L/Security

Kennedy,

Several months ago I wrote you a letter concerning the Pro-Castro sentiments of Court Wood, son of Foster Wood, a local attorney. Since that time I've seen Court only once, on March 3, 1961, and he appears to be actively engaged in the organization of a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE. Complete with beard, Court has been meeting with "interested groups" and lecturing to students in several eastern cities. He specifically mentioned Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Apparently there are a number of students involved in this activity. I met David Lacterran from George Mason High School in Falls Church, Va. and Walt MacDonald, a fellow student of Court's and both are obviously active.

What action, if any, should I take in regard to my relationship with Court and his father?

Please include this statement in my permanent record.

THANK YOU

Michael Stratton
WH/L/Reg.
