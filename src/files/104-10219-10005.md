REF: MEXICO CITY 44819 0613976

1. RAYMOND H. GERENDE, (IDENTITY A) WAS RECRUITED IN MARCH 1955 AS A MEMBER OF A STATION UNILATERAL SURVEILLANCE TEAM. GERENDE RECEIVED AN OPERATIONAL APPROVAL ON 28 FEB 55 AND ON 1 OCT 55 WAS CONVERTED TO CONTRACT STATUS WITH AN INITIAL ANNUAL SALARY OF $3600.

BY LATE 1956 HE HAD BECOME THE P/A IN CHARGE OF THE SURVEILLANCE TEAM AND ADDITIONALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF PHOTO SURVEILLANCE OF THE SOVIET MISSION, INCLUDING PROCESSING THE FILM. AT THIS TIME HE WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING "CONSCIENTIOUS, LOYAL, HARDWORKING AND DEDICATED." IN 1957 HE WAS GIVEN FIVE WEEKS OF CLANDESTINE OPS TRAINING IN THE HQS-AREA, BEING DESCRIBED BY HIS TRAINER AS MORE "PRO-AMERICAN THAN MEXICAN."

IN LATE 1958 HE WAS DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE STATION'S MOST VALUABLE ASSETS", ETC.

2. ON 12 DEC 58 GERENDE MARRIED LIEMPTY-19 (IDENTITY B), WHO ASSISTED HIM DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS A PART-TIME SUPPORT ASSET.

IN GENERAL GERENDE APPEARS TO HAVE PERFORMED A CREDITABLE JOB AS THE P/A FOR THE KDFACTOR ACTIVITY, WHICH PROVIDED SURVEILLANCE AND PHOTO COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET TARGET. AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION, HIS CONTRACT AGENT SALARY HAD INCREASED TO $7000 PER ANNUM. SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEPT FOR GIVING ENGLISH LESSONS AND OTHER MINOR COVER ACTIVITIES, GERENDE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A FULL-TIME RTACTION EMPLOYEE. HE PERFORMED A NUMBER OF TASKS IN ADDITION TO KDFACTOR, INCLUDING SERVING AS LP KEEPER AND TRANSCRIBER/TRANSLATOR OF AN AUDIO OPERATION, INVOLVEMENT IN OPS AGAINST THE CUBAN MISSION AND CUBAN EXILE GROUPS, GENERAL OPS SUPPORT, AND SPOTTING AND ASSESSMENT. ON 8 OCT 1963, GERENDE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED AN SGSWIRL, ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED THAT HE HAD NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL FUNDS PASSED TO HIM (THE STATION DISMISSED THIS PROBLEM) AND FELT THAT HE WAS BEING UNDEREMPLOYED BY RTACTION. CONCERNING THE LATTER CHARGE, THE STATION SEEMS TO HAVE HAD PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE 1960'S KEEPING GERENDE FULLY OCCUPIED, SINCE FOR SECURITY REASONS THERE WAS RELUCTANCE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO ANY MORE OPERATIONS THAN THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER HE WAS ALREADY AWARE OF.

(FYI: IN ADDITION TO HIS WIFE, GERENDE'S MOTHER, 201-0262488, AND TWO BROTHER-IN-LAWS (KDFACTOR-1) AND (KDADAGE-14) WERE ALSO STATION ASSETS.

3. IN 1969 GERENDE SEPARATED FROM LIEMPTY-19 IN WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE BEGINNING OF AN EXTREMELY ACRIMONIOUS DIVORCE PROCEEDING AND FIGHT FOR THE CUSTODY OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN. IN DECEMBER 1969 GERENDE WAS PUT ON HALF PAY AND HAD HIS OPS DUTIES SUSPENDED BY THE STATION BECAUSE OF HIS FULL-TIME INVOLVEMENT IN LEGAL MATTERS SURROUNDING THE DIVORCE. ON 26 JUNE 1970 GERENDE AND LIEMPTY-19 SIGNED QUIT CLAIMS AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS. GERENDE WAS PAID $10,000 AND LIEMPTY-19 $2500 AS TERMINATION BONUSES, AND THE PAYMENTS WERE MADE ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO THAT THE STATION WOULD HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THE TWO AND THEREBY KEEP THEIR RTACTION STATUS FROM EMERGING DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS. ON 8 JULY 1970 LIEMPTY-19 UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED AT HQS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER TERMINATION BONUS. SUBSEQUENTLY LIEMPTY-19 AND HER CHILDREN WENT TO RESIDE IN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, WHERE SHE WAS PAID THE REST OF HER TERMINATION BONUS VIA MONTHLY CHECKS SENT TO HER BROTHER IN THE HQS AREA. SHE WAS LAST REPORTED TO BE WORKING AS A SECRETARY AT THE U.S. MISSION IN THE HAGUE.

4. ACCORDING TO MEXICO CITY 19452, 10 APRIL 72, THE LAST STATION CONTACT WITH GERENDE WAS IN MAY 1971, WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF TERMINATION BONUS. CABLE NOTED THAT GERENDE APPEARED FINANCIALLY PRESSED, BUT WAS GIVING DAILY ENGLISH CLASSES AND RENTING HIS HOUSE TO STATION STAFFER JESSE R. GARDALPHE. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT EITHER GERENDE OR HIS WIFE HAD VIOLATED THEIR SECRECY AGREEMENTS. STATEMENT WAS MADE THAT HE NO LONGER APPEARED TO BE DRINKING EXCESSIVELY.

5. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GERENDE'S AGENT SERVICE RECORD QUALIFIES RECOMENDATION FOR HIS REUSE BY SAYING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FULL-TIME RTACTION EMPLOYMENT, AND HAVE RESOLVED HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EXCEPT FOR A POSSIBLE ROLE IN SERVICING SPECIFIC OPS SUPPORT TASKS, GERENDE OFFERS LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATION. SUGGEST THAT THE STATION MAY WISH TO DISCUSS GERENDE WITH THEODORE G. KINDOPP (P) UPON HIS ARRIVAL, SINCE GERENDE WAS HIS LANDLORD DURING PREVIOUS STAY IN MEXICO.

WE SPECIFICALLY DESIRE HOLD STATION INVOLVEMENT, EITHER MEXICO CITY OR THE HAGUE, TO A MINIMUM, AND CERTAINLY DO NOT WISH INVOLVE DUTCH.

2. GERENDE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT HAVE ANY HAGUE STATION CONTACT FURNISHED.

Dear Mr. Roos,

As you may be aware, your sister, Hester Roos de Alvarez was associated with this Agency in Mexico City for a number of years, and due to personal problems with her husband, her services (and those of her husband) with this Agency were formally terminated on 26 June 1970. In the termination agreement, this Agency agreed to pay Mrs. Hestor Roos de Alvarez a bonus payment amounting to $2500 payable in ten monthly installments of $250 beginning 31 July 1970. Since Mrs. Roos departed Mexico City in July 1970 and came to the U.S., she could not be contacted in Mexico City to receive these payments. While in the U.S., Mrs. Roos de Alvarez contacted our Agency on 8 July 1970 and requested we pay her the funds here; and while her request was being considered she departed the U.S. for Mexico, and later went to The Hague where she is residing at Ary Schefferstratt 47, The Hague, Netherlands. Mrs. Roos de Alvarez has written to this Agency from the Hague requesting we forward the payments to her via international mail
