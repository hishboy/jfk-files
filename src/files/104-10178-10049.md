As an application for buying a house at 6346 S.W. and 29th St. I made my application through Roso Realty that is located at 6345 Coral Way. I have to pay $100 down by the VA plan or $300 down by FHA plan and a monthly payment of $75.00. I have to use my cover of Tri-State for references. I filled an application and put in there that I was working for this Company for two years, that my salary was $120 a week, and that position in this Company is like an electronic technician. Would you please advise them of all this matter in order that when they will receive the papers from VA or FHA fill them the right way?

I can not use RECE for the application of this credit because an exile group corporation is no good for this kind of credit references. As I told you I am not going to use Tri-State any more but it is an exception.

COVER notified, they will handle. 20 September 1966
