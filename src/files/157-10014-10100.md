Chronology of Events

1959
November 4 Special Group discusses Allen DULLES' "Cuba Propaganda Project" for use of radio transmitters. GRAY said "he was sure (the project would meet with high level approval" provided it was acceptable to the President of Mexico.

GRAY represents President EISENHOWER at Special Group meetings.

1960 (Cont'd)
February 12 A "special" NSC meeting was held on this day. The only record of this meeting in the NSC minutes states: "On instructions from the Executive Secretary no memorandum was written." (NSC Minutes)
February 17 Special Group approves evaluation of agents for Cuban sugar mill sabotage. GRAY "discussed this matter with his associate" (Eisenhower) and reported two tactical objections. (SG Minutes)
March 9 GRAY tells Special Group that any covert action like sugar mill sabotage should be undertaken only after overall consideration of "whether and how the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO." (SG Minutes)
March 14 At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES "reported that a plan to affect the situation in Cuba was being worked on. Admiral BURKE suggested that any plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should be a package deal, since many of the leaders around CASTRO were even worse than CASTRO." (NSC Minutes)
April 7 At a Special Group meeting, after a paper titled "General Covert Action Plan for Cuba" was read, there was "a general discussion as to what would be the effect on the Cuban scene if FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO and CHE GUEVARA should disappear simultaneously." (SG Minutes)
"GRAY asked the [Special] Group's views on what happens after TRUJILLO, specifically how CASTRO can be kept out of the Dominican Republic." Acting DCI CABELL recommends U.S. military, intervention after TRUJILLO departs. (SG Minutes)

Issues and Questions
Why were no minutes written?
Does context show that phrase "his associate" refers to President EISENHOWER?
Did such consideration involve assassination plotting?
Was this "package deal" the simultaneous triple assassination plot that was mentioned on November 3, 1960?
Does this simultaneous disappearance plan refer to assassination planning?
Is there a connection between this Special Group discussion and the NSC discussion on March 14, 1960, re a plan to remove Cuban leaders?
Did U.S. support TRUJILLO'S opponents out of a desire to keep CASTRO out of the Dominican Republic?

April 14 At an NSC meeting presided over by Vice President NIXON, Allen DULLES reported "TRUJILLO'S position continued to weaken and was now quite precarious. [he] thought further attempts will be made to kill or oust TRUJILLO. Under Secretary of State DILLON said "if TRUJILLO could be removed from power in the Dominican Republic while pro-CASTRO elements were prevented from seizing power in that country, our anti-CASTRO campaign throughout Latin America would receive a great boost. The Vice President agreed that getting rid of TRUJILLO would be a favorable development for us." (NSC Minutes)
April 14 Allen DULLES predicted at an NSC meeting, that one possible outcome with respect to CASTRO was an assassination that would make CASTRO a martyr. (NSC Minutes)
June 30 GRAY says "the U.S. has taken publicly about all that it can afford to take from the CASTRO government." (SG Minutes)
July 1 Memo from the Chief of CIA's Western Hemisphere Division to the Acting DCI recommending delivery of high-powered rifles with telescopic scopes to the opponents of TRUJILLO. The memo said: "approval for delivery of these arms has been given by ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE ROY RUBOTTOM."
July 5 President EISENHOWER met with Secretary of State HERTER and others to discuss the Dominican Republic. "The President thought we should knock out of any documents on file any reference to starting a revolution." (Conference Memorandum)

Issues and Questions
Were these U.S. attempts to kill TRUJILLO?
DILLON'S comment indicates that the U.S. had an active interest in removing TRUJILLO
What did NIXON mean by "getting TRUJILLO"?
Does this show that assassination was not a favored alternative because it would produce martyrdom?
General atmosphere of vehement opposition to CASTRO.
Was the Special Group aware of this action
Was the President aware of the plan?
Purpose of weapons?

Issues and Questions
July 7 Allen DULLES reported to the NSC that the Venezuelan government wants the United States to lead the way in breaking relations with TRUJILLO. DULLES stated: The Venezuelan government was engaged in an all-out effort, through the OAS and otherwise, to isolate, condemn and cause the downfall of TRUJILLO. [Because] they have convincing evidence that TRUJILLO was responsible for the assassination attempt on BETANCOURT [President of Venezuela] BETANCOURT believes another attempt will be made momentarily and therefore it [his government] wants a showdown without delay." (NSC Minutes)
July 21 "Mr. DULLES stated that he believes, and the intelligence community agrees, that the problem of TRUJILLO must be settled before the problem of CASTRO can be dealt with, even though CASTRO is the greater threat." (NSC Minutes)

The NSC Minutes further state that BETANCOURT was told that the U.S. cannot act without ascertaining TRUJILLO'S successor. The U.S. will work with BETANCOURT and FIGUERES of Costa Rica on suggestions for a successor to TRUJILLO. President EISENHOWER suggested that a government in exile should be ready to go into the Dominican Republic in the event of TRUJILLO'S downfall. (NSC Minutes)
GRAY said "his associates" would favor the development of sabotage operations in CUBA. (SG Minutes)

The U.S. was under pressure to move against TRUJILLO.
Did TRUJILLO'S attempt against BETANCOURT make him "fair game" for assassination in the eyes of OAS nations including the U.S.
Did the U.S. determine a successor?
Did the U.S. "act"?
"Associate" is the euphemism for Eisenhower.
Does sabotage imply the further steps of assassination?

Issues and Questions
July 28 President EISENHOWER stated at an NSC meeting: "Until TRUJILLO is eliminated, we cannot get our Latin American friends to reach a proper level of indignation in dealing with CASTRO." In this regard, "the President said if we attempted to take any action with respect to Cuba before settling the TRUJILLO situation, we would be the loser." (NSC Minutes)
August 12 BISSELL outlines 13.3 million dollar budget for Cuban operations which was to be laid before "higher authorities" for decision. (SG Minutes)
August 16 Dr. Edward GUNN (CIA Office of Medical Services) receives box of Cuban cigars to be treated with lethal poison for use against CASTRO. (IG REPORT p. 21).
August 25 After the Special Group approved anti-LUMUMBA operations in the Congo, "GRAY commented, however, that his associates had expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very straightforward action in this situation, and he wondered whether the plans as outlined would be sufficient to accomplish this. It was finally agreed that planning for the Congo would not necessarily rule out 'consideration' of any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of LUMUMBA." (SG Minutes; emphasis added)
August (approx) At the NSC meeting, Mr. STANS suggested that the U.S. might "throw out LUMUMBA by peaceful means." (NSC Minutes)
BISSELL asks EDWARDS to find underworld contacts with Cuba to aid in an assassination operation

Does "elimination" mean "assassination"?
Were EISENHOWER, GRAY, or DCI DULLES aware of this?
Is this circumlocutious order for assassination from the President? An indication that at the least, assassination was within the range of acceptable means for "getting rid of LUMUMBA"?
Were EISENHOWER, GRAY, or Allen DULLES aware of this? Was it authorized by

Issues and Questions
September 8 During brief discussion of CONGO developments, "GRAY said that he hoped that Agency people in the field are fully aware of the top-level feeling in Washington that vigorous action would not be amiss." (SG Minutes; emphasis added)
September 21 Allen DULLES stated at an NSC meeting that "LUMUMBA was not disposed of and remained a great danger as long as he was not disposed of." (NSC Minutes)
October 24 At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES reported that "five Congolese soldiers had attempted to assassinate MOBUTO on the 15th of October. The U.S. had prior information of this attempt and had warned MOBUTO (NSC Minutes)
November 3 At a Special Group meeting, Mr. MERCHANT "asked whether any real planning has been done in taking direct positive action against FIDEL, RAUL and CHE GUEVARA. He said that without these three the Cuban government would be leaderless and probably brainless. He conceded that it would be necessary to act against all three simultaneously."

The minutes further state: "General CABELL pointed out that action of this kind is uncertain of results and highly dangerous in conception and execution, because the instruments must be Cuban. He felt that, particularly because of the necessity of simultaneous action, it would have to be concluded that Mr. MERCHANT'S suggestion is beyond our capabilities." (SG Minutes)

Against LUMUMBA personally?
Did the NSC contemplate "disposing of" LUMUMBA by assassination?
Did this information prompt the U.S. to plot the assassination of LUMUMBA in retaliation or to protect MOBUTO?
Was MERCHANT referring to an assassination of Cuban leaders?
Shortly before this, CIA had made the assassination contract with the Mafia. Was General CABELL unaware of this CIA contract? Was General CABELL expressing a traditional CIA objection to assassination proposals? If so, on what other occasion did Mr. GRAY hear the CIA objection?

Issues and Questions
December 29 At a Special Group meeting, Mr. BISSELL gave the broad outlines of a two-pronged plan for proceeding with certain limited covert activities directed against the TRUJILLO regime, but "he also emphasized that the proposed actions would not of themselves bring about the desired result in the near future, lacking some decisive stroke against TRUJILLO himself."

January 12 Special Group approves the State Department proposal explained by MERCHANT "that limited supplies of small arms and other material should be made available for dissidents inside the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC." (SG Minutes; emphasis added)
Late Jan.- Early Feb. DDP BISSELL asks William HARVEY to establish an EXECUTIVE ACTION capability under project ZRRIFLE. HARVEY'S notes are quoted as saying that BISSELL said he had been "twice urged by the White House" to establish such a capability, including the capability to assassinate political leaders.

TRUJILLO was assassinated on May 30, 1961.
Did Mr. BISSELL or the Special Group propose to approve aiding Dominicans who might assassinate TRUJILLO to effect such a "decisive stroke"?
Were these assassination-type weapons?
If not, was this Special Group action used as implicit authority for subsequent provision of weapons for the assassination of TRUJILLO?
Was the EXECUTIVE ACTION project initiated or authorized during the EISENHOWER Administration?

GORDON GRAY: Short Summary

Gordon Gray was Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from 1958-1961. During this period Gray represented President EISENHOWER at Special Group meetings at which the following subjects were discussed: "any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of LUMUMBA"; provision of small arms to opponents to TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic; and detailed planning for "how the U. S. wishes to move against CASTRO".

Gray's testimony should involve the following questions (see attached list of exhibits):

CASTRO
1. What was Admiral Burke referring to at the March 14, 1960, NSC meeting when he spoke of "a plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should be a package deal"? (Exhibit at Tab E)
2. Is there a connection between the plan referred to by Admiral Burke at the March 14 NSC meeting and the discussion at the March 14 Special Group meeting on the "effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and Raoul Castro and Che Guevara should disappear simultaneously"? (Exhibit at Tab F)
3. Were President Eisenhower or Mr. Gray aware that on August 16, 1960, the CIA Office of Medical Services received a box of Cuban cigars to be treated with poison for use against Castro? (Exhibit at Tab O)
4. Were President Eisenhower or Mr. Gray aware that in August 1960 Bissell asked Edwards to find underworld contacts with Cuba for an assassination mission? (Exhibit at Tab R)
5. At the November 3, 1960, Special Group meeting, was Mr. Merchant referring to planning for assassination when he asked whether planning had been done "in taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raoul, and Che Guevara"? How does General Cabell's response (that Merchant's suggestion "is beyond our capabilities") square with the fact that shortly before November 1960 the CIA had made contact with the Mafia for a Castro assassination effort? (Exhibit at Tab V)

TRUJILLO
1. Was Vice President Nixon referring to assassination at the April 14, 1960, NSC meeting when he said "getting rid of Trujillo would be a favorable development"? (Exhibit at Tab H)

NW 50955 DocId: 32423488 Page 15

2. Was the Special Group, Mr. Gray, or President Eisenhower aware that Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom was reported, on July 1, 1960, by the CIA Western Hemisphere Division Chief to have approved delivery of high-powered rifles with telescopic sights to Trujillo opponents? (Exhibit at Tab YZ)
3. When President Eisenhower was reported at the July 28, 1960, NSC meeting to have said that "until Trujillo is eliminated . . .", was he referring to an assassination? (Exhibit at Tab M)
4. On January 12, 1961, the Special Group approved making available "small arms" to dissidents in the Dominican Republic. Were these assassination-type weapons such as the rifles with telescopic sights referred to in Exhibit at Tab YZ? (Exhibit at Tab X re January 12 meeting)
5. Did the attempts by Trujillo to assassinate President Betancourt of Venezuela prompt the Special Group to favor supplying arms to Dominican dissidents who might try to assassinate Trujillo? (Exhibit at Tab K)

LUMUMBA
1. When Mr. Gray commented at the August 25, 1960, Special Group meeting that "his associates had expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very straight-forward action", was he referring to assassination? Do Mr. Dulles' reservations indicate that he was objecting to a suggested assassination? (Exhibit at Tab P)
2. When Mr. Gray said at the Special Group meeting on September 8, 1960, that "he hoped that agency people in the field are fully aware of the top level feeling in Washington that vigorous action would not be amiss", was he referring to assassination of Lumumba? (Exhibit at Tab S)

COMMAND and CONTROL

What was the command and control system for covert action operations in the Eisenhower Administration?

Pertinent Relationships

President Eisenhower Gray was the President's liaison to the intelligence community and the National Security Council (including the Special Group).
DCI Allen Dulles Gray met with Dulles in the Special Group.
DDP Richard Bissell Gray knew Bissell well. Bissell initiated the CIA-Gambling Syndicate plot to assassinate Castro and the Executive Action capability.

GORDON GRAY: SHORT SUMMARY
SECRET

Gordon Gray was Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from 1958-61. During this period Gray represented President EISENHOWER at Special Group meetings at which the following subjects were discussed:

"any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of LUMUMBA;" provision of small arms to opponents of TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic; and detailed planning for "how the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO"

Gray's testimony should involve the following questions:

*   Did any of the Special Group meetings implicitly or explicitly contemplate or plan assassination attempts against LUMUMBA, TRUJILLO, or CASTRO?
*   To what extent were CIA plans against these leaders authorized by or made known to President EISENHOWER, Gordon GRAY, DCI Allen DULLES, or the Special Group as a whole?
*   What were the general command & control practices?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 3 November 1960
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant, Douglas, Gray, Gen. Cabell, Gen. Lansdale

1. Cuba

Mr. Gray inquired once more as to the status of planning for problems which would arise post-Castro. Mr. Merchant said he would check into the progress of the State Department group which has been charged with developing recommendations on this matter.

From this the Group launched into a far-ranging discussion of the entire concept of U.S. efforts against Castro. Mr. Douglas, supported by Mr. Gray and Mr. Merchant, expounded the idea that perhaps things have now progressed to a point where covert activities of the type originally envisaged for CIA to undertake will not be effective. Mr. Douglas referred to the extensive program of the militia, Mr. Gray cited the matter of arms from the Soviet bloc, and Mr. Merchant dwelt on the increasing effectiveness of Castro's measures to control the population in ways which the Communists have developed so well. The latter said that he and others in the State Department had originally thought that a popular rebellion would develop within Cuba and that this could be augmented by the comparatively small-scale efforts of exiles under CIA control. Now the same people are beginning to feel more and more that despite the numerous defections and the economic deprivations being experienced by the middle and upper classes, time is actually working on Castro's side. Mr. Merchant said that he foresaw that there would occur a point in time beyond which covert intervention would not do the job.

Mr. Gray expressed the opinion that we will never be able to "clean up" the situation without the use of overt U.S. military force. He suggested the possibility of using the CIA-backed exiles to mount a simulated attack on Guantanamo in order to offer an excuse for overt

intervention. This led to an involved discussion, the general conclusion of which was that such action on our part would not be desirable, but that should Castro be foolish enough actually to attack Guantanamo this would almost certainly mean war. Mr. Gray said that he had had the subject of Cuba inscribed on the NSC agenda for next Monday in order to be able to arrive at a top-level decision on this very point. He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should be completely understood by responsible officials, so that any overt Cuban act would be met with a previously-agreed-on response.

Mr. Merchant stated that, apart from any attack on Guantanamo, he thought that some of the previous argumentation in today's meeting was faulty, in that we could not have it both ways. By this he meant that it is not logical to conclude that an indigenous uprising is impossible and yet that it is feasible for the U.S. to go in overtly and "clean up the mess." He pointed out that if Castro's support were such that an uprising was out of the question then an open invasion by the U.S. would be met by a hostile population and we would be plunged into a situation like Algeria.

Turning to the immediate problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell outlined the general proposal to establish bases in the U.S., with the reasons for coming to this conclusion.
