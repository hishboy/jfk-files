For several years he served in responsible positions at Headquarters and was promoted to GS-15 in 1957. In 1959 he returned to Tokyo as Deputy for Operations and as DCOS until 1964. He was promoted to GS-16 in August 1964. From 1964-1966 he served at Honolulu Base. In 1965 he was appointed COB, Honolulu. From 1966-68 he served in the Office of Planning, Programming and Budgeting. In 1968 he was reassigned to the Missions and Programs Staff and in 1971 was appointed Chief, MPS and served there until January 1972 during which period he was promoted to GS-17. In 1972 he was appointed Chief of the then designated Nonofficial Cover Affairs Division (presently Nonofficial Cover Affairs Branch), from which assignment he is retiring.

Mr. Wheeler's outstanding characteristics are his integrity and total dedication. He is a natural leader, bright and original. He has a creative mind, is articulate and rational. He has excellent recall, is a gifted administrator and manager. He is a searching individual who is totally committed and has the high regard of most of the elements comprising the DDO. During his tenure he has received laudatory commendations for his efforts.

Mr. Wheeler has made a valuable contribution to the Agency during his extended career and it is fitting that upon retirement after such a distinguished career, he be awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit.

Dear Pete,

I want to thank you personally for your fine work as a member of the GS-15 Evaluation Board which convened from 15 May to 16 June 1972. I know that this work has been particularly demanding. Your full-time participation and diligent application of your professional experience have been decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the Board's missions. I know that your recommendations will provide a reliable base for the Clandestine Service Career Service Board and myself in arriving at a final promotion list.

Your wise and energetic participation in the evaluation process has helped to strengthen the Clandestine Service by objectively identifying those officers whose performance, qualifications and potential mark them as especially fitted for senior positions of leadership.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion -

Robert P. Wheeler

1. As one of the final acts in my CIA career I want

to bring to your attention and add my strong concurrence

in and recommendation to two (2) recorded recommendations for

the promotion of Robert P. Wheeler to the grade GS-17. I

find it hard to imagine a more persuasive recommendation

for this action than that forwarded by my predecessor in

June 1969 (Attached). I can imagine Mr. Mitchell's feeling

when he prepared the second recommendation in February 1970

(Attached). And yet, I find in February 1971 there has still

been no action. In the year that has passed this promotion

has become even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-

appointment accompanying such a continuing lack of recogni-

tion, there has been no diminution of enthusiasm, no lowering

of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed because

of his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen-

dations not so clearcut and descriptive, I would conclude

that those in control simply do not know what this officer

does and has done. Knowing what he does and how he does it

should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my

strongest recommendation for early and favorable action.

2. This officer has performed in a most outstanding

manner, as testified in his fitness reports by my prede-

cessor, and certainly during my tenure as Chief, MPS for

the past 12 months.

5 JUN 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career

Service Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for the Promotion of

Mr. Robert P. Wheeler to GS-17

1. It is recommended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be

promoted to GS-17.

2. Mr. Wheeler obtained a B.A. degree in Political

Science from the University of California, Berkeley, in

1942 and a M.A. in International Relations from George

Washington University, Washington, D.C., in 1946. He

entered the U.S. Navy in 1942 and after a concerted course

in Japanese served the Navy until 1946 as an Intelligence

Specialist, Japanese Language officer, and the War Depart-

ment, still as an Intelligence Specialist in Tokyo, from

1946 to 1952. In September 1952 he joined the Agency for

duty in Tokyo; returned to Headquarters in June 1956 where

he served until 1959; left for service in Japan from June

1959 to October 1964; served under non-official cover in

Honolulu from August 1964 to August 1966; served at Head-

quarters with the Office of Planning, Programming and

Budgeting (OPPB) from August 1966 until January 1968, and

with MPS from the latter date to the present date.

3. During his career with the Agency he has been a

field Operations Officer, Liaison Officer to overseas U.S.

agencies and a foreign intelligence service, supervisor,

Deputy Chief of Station (Tokyo), Chief FI for a division

(FR), Chief of Base (Honolulu), Program Analyst (OPPD),

and Program Analyst and Group Chief (MPS).

4. In his present position as Chief of Programs Group

in the Missions and Programs Staff, Mr. Wheeler is respon-

sible for liaison between the CS and the OPPB on the PPB

System and non-budgetary matters; installing the PPB System

within the CS; advising and assisting CS components in the

preparation of Operating Directives and the program portions

of the annual responses to the Program Call; chairing the

Program Review Panel; preparing and/or coordinating special

studies and surveys on operational programs; coordinating

and preparing the annual PPB report to the PFIAE; preparing

the annual DDP briefing of the PCI on CS problems and

progress; and, as required, advising CS components on the

requirements of PPBS that need to be addressed in CS docu-

ments requiring DCI or Executive Director-Comptroller

action.

5. In his previous assignment Mr. Wheeler was detailed

to OPPB to give that office, in the preparation of Agency

programs for submission to the Bureau of the Budget, a better

understanding of clandestine collection and covert action,

to help that office better review and integrate CS programs

in Agency programs, and to give him a broad view of the PPB

System and Agency management in both of which he had shown

considerable interest. His performance in that office was

rated "Strong," and it was on that performance and on his

genuine enthusiasm and interest in management generally that

his services were sought for MPS.

6. In the performance of his duties as Chief, MPG/PPRG

he made immediate use of his long experience in and know-

ledge of CS operations, the experience and knowledge gained

in G2PD, his formal education in the PPB System, and a

strong belief in and desire to put to work within the CS

certain concepts of that system for general and specific

management improvement. Given the idiosyncrasies of the

CS, he recognized early that in order to make the PPB

system work effectively knowledge of the "why" and "how" of

that system must be possessed at every decision-making level.

With limitless energy and enthusiasm he set about "preaching

the gospel" from division chief to case officer. Whenever

and wherever a formal group is assembled and management is

a topic for discussion the Office of Training can count on

him to drop everything and hold forth on the subject, be it

the Senior Management and Planning Course (whether for

supergrades or below), Station Chief Conferences, the CS

Senior Seminar (now in session) and the like. Acting as

the DDP/TR's right arm to encourage attendance at the

Senior Management and Planning Course he has crusaded with

division and staff chiefs for the attendance of certain of

their key employees. To date upwards of 100 from the CS

have attended that course with many more to follow. With

some of those same senior officials he has argued the ben-

efits ultimately to accrue to their components from the

temporary assignment of a senior key official for a year

or two to MPS and/or CPT and eventual return to the mother

component. One such arrangement, with duty in OPPB, has

just been completed. His tactful, understanding, friendly,

businesslike, professional and competent handling of the

chairmanship of the PRP and the reviews of the operating

Directive and country activities conducted by that Panel

leaves little to be desired. Regarding the PPB System,

he reads everything, pro and con, that comes to his atten-

tion, and he has spent a fair sum out of his own pocket

to build a library on the subject. He has persuaded a

potential convert to the system to read those books,

magazines, periodicals and pamphlets to the end that most

of that library is on constant loan. His insatiable

appetite for news on current as well as historical domestic

and foreign matters, his excellent sense of humor, and his

genuine friendliness are invaluable assets in his present

assignment inasmuch as they have given him such a wide

range of acquaintances, in and out of the CS, as to open

wide the door for discussion on MPS responsibilities that

are anything but sexy. He is so highly regarded by his

contacts in the divisions and staffs of the CS and in OPPD

that his advice and guidance are constantly sought. He

gives of his time and energy willingly, regardless of the

grade of the individual or the magnitude of the problem.

His enthusiasm is catching and he sets an excellent example

for subordinates, equals and superiors as well.

7. In view of the above, Mr. Wheeler, a broadly gauged,

fast moving, competent, dedicated, sincere and friendly

individual who has not yet reached his full potential,

whose goal is to make the Clandestine Service the best

managed directorate in CIA, and who will soon have served

five years in grade, is strongly recommended for promotion

to GS-17.
