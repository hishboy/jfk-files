Requirements on Remaining Source Reports

Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITSYN

[TEPYARONA] did not in fact meet [GOSTWA] as previously stated but only knew of her and GOLITSYN from her parents.

2. Source is quite clear about GOLUBEV's instructions and had not confused the names of COMITSYN and NOSENKO. GOLUBEV had been sent a directive from Moscow setting out his main tasks. This was couched in somewhat rough, direct words in order to put him on the right lines. Source did not deduce from what was in this directive that the K.G.B. believed that either man was living in England. It certainly stated that NOSENKO had visited England after his defection and that GOLITSYN had visited England several times. Source knows only what GOLUBEV told him and what was in the directive; he has no idea why the K.G.B. believed that either of the two defectors had visited the U.K.

Para.

[Lavlovich EN MO]

It is stated here that Source's wife, while visiting her parents in [ ], heard [ ]'s story (presumably this means his defection) and also met his wife. The word order implies that she met Mrs. GOLITSYN after hearing about the defection, but this could not be, since Mrs. GOLITSYN defected with her husband. Please clarify this and give details of the GOLITSYN story she heard. What were the dates of her visit to [ ]?

Para. 3-b: The wording of this paragraph is almost identical to much of paragraph 3-b of Source's report on Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO, regarding GOLUBEV's instructions.

KGB belief that both defectors had visited England, and attempts to locate them, etc. The only reference as given in these reports is that NOSENKO is said to have been in the UK in 1965, and GOLITSYN "several times". Since NOSENKO did not visit the UK in 1965 but we understand that GOLITSYN did make several visits, we wonder (in view of the strong similarities in wording) if there may be a garble in Source's reporting. Does Source have any idea as to why the KGB believed either of the two defectors had visited the UK?
