Unidentified Visitor to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1. LICALLA and LILYRIC reported an unidentified visitor to the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City between 29 November and 3 December 1965. The visitor appears
to be a Soviet; however, LIFIRE has not reported any unaccounted for Soviet
to have visited Mexico during this period, nor was the presence of a Soviet
visitor reported to the Station by any other source. He has not been seen
since 3 December 1965.

2. According to LICALLA, the visitor was principally in contact with the
cook, Anatoliy Aleksandrovich MUKHIN (201-293944), administrative assistant
Stanislav Sergeyevich SILNIKOV (201-271103), guard Nikolay Ivanovich CANWAROW,
code clerk Aleksandr Petrovich PAVLOV (201-761265), Third Secretary and known
KGB officer Vladimir Ivanovich SUKHAREVITCH (201-343894), First Secretary and
known KGB officer Aleksandr Vladimirovich PRIKHODKO (201-202379), and Press
Attach√© and known KGB officer Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV (201-1-32139).

3. According to LILYRIC, the visitor was seen leaving the Soviet Embassy
with MUKHIN, and later with Third Secretary and suspect KGB officer
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412) on 30 November 1965. On 1 December
he was seen leaving with MUKHIN and his wife, Commercial Counselor Georgiy
Stepanovich VISKO (201-243602) and chauffeur Anatoliy Pavlovich PRASIKHIKIN
(201-735052) in the car normally driven by Pravda correspondent Vladimir
Agafonovich DOLGOV (201-763035). On 2 December he was seen leaving with
MUKHIN and his wife, ZAKHAROV, visitor Ferdinand Robertovich CINNO and
(continued).

1. LICOZY/5 reported that on 12 October 1965 Subject visited
his place of business and said that he had been referred to LICOZY/5
by the Soviet Embassy. He said he was interested in a one-way ticket
to the Soviet Union. Subject furnished the following information
to LICOZY/5: He was born on 19 August 1942 in Michigan. He is
a student at U.C.L.A. and wanted to visit the USSR as a tourist.

Subject held U. S. passport number C 530394 issued 29 August 1962.
His permanent address was given as 19222 Pacific Coast Highway,
Malibu, California. His tourist card showed that he entered Mexico
by bus at Sonoita, Sonora on 9 October 1965. Subject paid for 15
days in the Soviet Union but said that he planned to stay longer.

2. He left Mexico via Air France flight 702 on 16 October
(confirmed by flight manifests). His plans call for him to depart
Paris for Moscow via Air France flight 724 on 17 October.

3. During a routine visit to the Consular Section of the Soviet
Embassy, Valentin S. LOGINOV thanked LICOZY/5 for "taking care"
of Subject but, in the presence of both PRIKHODKO and Consular
officer Vladimir S. KORMUSHKIN, LOGINOV admonished LICOZY/5 for asking
for more biographic data than he needed to fill out the necessary
papers.
LICOZY/5 denied that he had asked for more information than
he needed. (Subject apparently reported LICOZY/5's actions in
obtaining the above biographic data (or was debriefed by LOGINOV,
a suspect KGB officer).

4. It seems unusual for an American student to travel from the
U. S. to Mexico in order to travel to the Soviet Union since he is
automatically increasing the cost of his travel by a considerable
amount. Since Subject crossed into Mexico on 9 October, only a
week before his departure for the USSR, it would appear that he
came to Mexico exclusively for this purpose.
It thus appears that
the purpose of travelling via Mexico was to conceal this trip from
the U. S. authorities.

11. CURRICULUM VITAE:
A February 1960 Diplomatic List from Argentina lists Subject as
a new Soviet Military Attache due to arrive in Buenos Aires in the near
future. There is no indication that Subject ever filled that post.
From September 1960 to September 1963, Subject and family were
in Havana where Subject served as an Attache at the Soviet Embassy. In
December 1961, he accompanied the Soviet DYNAMO soccer team on a Latin
American tour as their escort and interpreter.
Subject arrived in Mexico City on 3 August 1965 to replace known
KGB officer Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO (201 305870), as a Third
Secretary.
12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:
Subject is listed as probable RIS, probably KGB on the basis of
his activities while stationed in Havana and by virtue of his replacing
a known KGB officer in Mexico City. Per HMMA-28390, 3 Mar 66 Subject
is considered known KGB.
13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
While Subject accompanied the DYNAMO soccer team through La Paz
in December 1961, he became acquainted with KISHIN-1 (Identity 1), a
KUBARK Bolivian security service penetration and later a low level
Bolivian university-cell CP penetration. It is not recorded upon whose
initiative the contacts were made. However, by KISHIN-1's admission
he had several informal and friendly meetings with Subject during which
Subject encouraged KISHIN-1 to accept a Cuban student grant. In fact he
specifically expressed an eagerness to be of any assistance in helping
KISHIN-1 to get to Cuba. KISHIN-1 never went to Cuba, although he did

SECRET
13. (CONTINUED)
correspond with Subject on the matter on at least one occasion.
KISHIN-1
was terminated as an agent in July 1963 for security reasons and because
it was believed that he was a fabricator. No further developments in
his association with Subject were noted.
On the same trip through Latin America in December 1961, Subject
was observed to have in his possession some $2,000 in United States
currency. After sending the soccer team back to Moscow from Quito,
Subject continued alone through Panama City, where he was seen in contact
with a Mexican citizen with whom he flew on to Mexico City. In Mexico
City Subject reported to known KGB officer Aleksey Ivanovich GARMASHOV
(201 227418) at the Soviet Embassy. From a sensitive source it was
learned that GARMASHOV had been instructed to look into the matter of
Subject's four-day delay in returning to Havana from Quito and that
Subject's superiors in Havana were concerned. It is not known what
relationship, if any, these circumstances have to each other.
In Havana early in 1963, Subject befriended and apparently attempted
to cultivate VASLOUCHS 1, 2, and 3 (Identities 2, 3, and 4). The
association was discouraged by KUBARK because VASLOUCH-1 and 2 were
performing important functions in connection with Cuban FI activities and
contact with a possible RIS officer was not thought desireable.
In September 1962 at the invitation of Senhor Vazco Leitao de CUNHA,
Brazilian Ambassador to Cuba and newly appointed Ambassador to the Soviet
Union, VASLOUCH-3 traveled to Moscow and accepted a clerical position
at the Brazilian Embassy where she remained for approximately two years.
Between
a year later, in September 1963, Subject returned PCS to Moscow.
December 1963 and February 1964, Subject made three attempts to see
VASLOUCH-3. According to VASLOUCH-3, the contacts were by telephone only
SECRET

SECRET
13. (CONTINUED)
and she did not meet with Subject personally while in Moscow.
15. CONTACTS:
In December 1961 in La Paz, Bolivia, Subject was in contact with
KISHIN-1. See paragraph 13 above and Identities.
Subject was in contact in Panama City and on a flight from Panama
City to Mexico City in December 1961 with Edmundo Fausto ZORRILLA
Martinez, a Mexican citizen who had been traveling around Latin America.
The nature of this contact has not been determined.
Subject befriended and apparently attempted to develop in Havana
VASLOUCHS 1, 2, and 3. See paragraph 13 above and Identities.
