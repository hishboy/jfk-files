PROPOSED ACTION (Include Branch and/or field recommendations;

utility of individual for Branch area and over-
all Division needs)

The contract for Raymond H. GERENDE expires on 30 September
1965. The Mexico City Station has recommended that the contract
be extended for one year, and that GERENDE be granted a salary
increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum.

GERENDE received his last salary raise on 1 August 1963,
from $5,500 to $6,000. He was first placed under contract on
1 October 1955 at $3,600.

There are sufficient funds in the LIEMPTY Project to cover
this salary increase, and GERENDE's local cover job can logically
cover this additional income.

Chronological Narrative
Performance Report

(Summary of evaluation of past performance (if applicable) with emphasis
and details of current performance for assigned operational tasks)

DATES LOCATION AGENCY TASK

GERENDE was recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from
the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance
team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data
on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of
the team.

He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
processor of tapes. He excelled in this type of work because of his bi-
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his diver-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permited him to spot
operational leads.

Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobile photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic take
and services the majority of the accomodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation

He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited
to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career. The Station
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
as a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very
little time.

In case of "New Hire" give a personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of
Division personnel who have interviewed him; give account of his
performance in current non-Agency job.

of GERENDE's increased operational responsibility and the professional
manner in which he carries out his operational assignments, it is requested
that his contract be amended to provide for a salary increase from
$6,000 U. S. per annum to $6,500 per annum.

2. Project LIEMPTY can absorb this additional expense and GERENDE's

DISPATCH
Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
FROM
Chief of Station, Mexico City
SUBJECT
Raymond H. GERENDE
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
Reference: HMMW-12284 dated 24 January 1964

1. Station Mexico City fully agrees with Headquarters evaluation of Subject as
a "valuable long term asset with stay behind potential." In order to place the matter
of the 2,100 pesos in the appropriate frame of reference it is felt that a few back-
ground points should be noted.

In January 1956 the LIEMPTY/LILYRIC basehouse was set up and placed in operation
in a site which provided visual coverage of the LIMERICK installation. A deposit of
three months rent was made per terms of the rental contract at that time (2,100 pesos.)
In April 1961 the building in which LIEMPTY/LILYRIC is located was sold by the owner.
Normally the rental deposit would have been transferred to the new comer as part of
the sale transaction. However, approximately three months after the transfer of the
property to the new owner, the rental deposit was returned to the basehouse operator,
LIEMPTY-13. The deposit was then returned to GERENDE. GERENDE did not inform the
then LIEMPTY case officer nor the present case officer of the return of the LIEMPTY/
LILYRIC deposit. This 2,100 pesos continued to be carried on the Station books as
an outstanding operational advance charged to GERENDE. GERENDE used part of this
2,100 pesos to make loans to two sub-agents (LIEMPTY-6 and LIEMPTY-9.) It is probably
that he also used some of this on occasion for his own purposes.

On 16 October 1963 GERENDE returned the 2,100 pesos to the case officer and the
Station has adjusted its books to reflect the return of this money. GERENDE noted
at the time of the return that he had this money intact but did not know how to go
about returning it so long after having received it. This is the same as he stated at
the time of the LCFLUTTER interview. GERENDE was obviously impressed with his inability
to "beat" the LCFLUTTER. He was sincerely remorseful when talking to the case officer

(Continued)

Distribution:
C/WHD

---

about the incident and has twice stated that nothing of this nature would happen again.
With the reality of future LCFLUTTER tests set firmly in GERENDE's mind, it is believed
that he will not attempt any such action again.

As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than periodic re-LCFLUTTER) to
prevent recurrence it must be noted that GERENDE kept apart the 2,100 pesos which were
really still charged to him and the Station had no way of knowing that the money had
been returned to him by the basehousekeeper. Only when the close down of the LIEMPTY/
LILYRIC basehouse would be effected would the Station expect to have the rental deposit
returned. Until such time the deposit would remain charged to GERENDE. The only way
to completely safeguard against this type of action would be for the case officer to
meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby eliminating GERENDE from the operation
and causing unacceptable security risks. It is believed that periodic LCFLUTTER of
GERENDE is the best insurance against a similar occurence in the future.

As to GERENDE's regular operational revolving fund, irregularities have never
been discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are conducted by the
case officer to control the unspent portion of the revolving fund by comparison with
accountings (receipts) GERENDE takes every two weeks. GERENDE's revolving fund is
kept at the minimum amount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for which
GERENDE is responsible.

The "other false claims" GERENDE admitted making involved occasional use of his
OP vehicle for personal driving while entering all receipts for gas on his KUBARK
accountings. Station does not consider this a major problem. If GERENDE used his car for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him would be relatively
easy (i.e., surveilling only when he is using his OP vehicle) and it is believed that
latitude must be allowed in this area for indigenous agents.

2. In the area of GERENDE's morale and his statement that he "is not being
utilized to his full potential" the Station is as fully concerned as Headquarters. It
should be noted however, that GERENDE has never written the report setting forth what
he thinks he can do and when prodded on this has stated that he had been thinking about
what additional work he could assume and that he "just does not know". The reason he
gives is he does not know what else is being done in the operations area other than that
to which he is already exposed. Additional operational work is assigned to GERENDE
when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.
An example of this was his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station is reluctant
to expose GERENDE to additional operations only for the purpose of improving his morale"
since he already has considerable knowledge of many Station past and going operations.
The Station appreciates Headquarters comments on the results of GERENDE's LCFLUTTER
and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GERENDE in
the future.

1. Reference is made to the results of the LCFLUTTER interview
of Raymond H. GERENDE which was held on 8 October 1963. Headquarters
would like to have a progress report on what steps have been taken
by the Case Officer with regard to the 2,100 pesos which he had
kept but belonged to KUBARK. Headquarters is also interested in
what has been done about other false claims he admitted making in
his accountings, and what precautions are being taken to see that
this does not continue in the future.

2. The Station's comments are requested on GERENDE's statement
that he is not being utilized to his full potential and that he
often has free time. Headquarters would be interested in seeing
a copy of the report which the LCFLUTTER examiner suggested he write,
setting forth what he (GERENDE) thinks he can do and what he would
like to do. Headquarters considers GERENDE a valuable long term
asset with staybehind potential, and it is hoped that the Station
will do what it can within the limits of security, to raise his morale
and see that KUBARK is receiving full benefit of his services.

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment No. One is GERENDE's signed
contract amendment. GERENDE is most appreciative for the raise in salary
and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment clause.
2. The Station interprets the Terminal Payment clause to mean any
termination by the Government or acceptance of GERENDE's resignation in
the "best interests of the Government." Examples in connection with the "best
interests of the Government" interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation
for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a change of residence
to some geographical area where his services could not be utilized by KUBARK.
Assuming that no security problems are involved in making such a payment, the
Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to GERENDE's estate
in the event of his death while in the employ of KUBARK.
3. The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as
originally requested and concurs in Headquarters reasoning. Certainly, the Station
would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he has been so informed,
if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money or to pursue some other
career. The Station hastens to add, however, that to the best of its knowledge,
GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK job.
4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No. Two are the
original and one copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957. Head-
quarters will note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by
the Chief of Station, but was not formally witnessed. It is suggested that Matthew
S. DINGLEY (ps), who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the
document. DINGLEY was the Case Officer handling GERENDE at the time this
amendment became effective.

1. In accordance with your request to amend Subject's contract
providing him with an increase in compensation and a termination
payment, the attached contract amendment was written.

2. Paragraph (a) of this amendment states that the figure
$3600 is deleted from GERENDE's contract and in lieu thereof the
figure $4560 is substituted. This figure of $3600 is the amount
GERENDE was to receive under his original contract, dated 1 October 1955.
According to the referenced dispatch, however, Subject's contract was
amended on 1 September 1957 to provide him with an increase in compensation,
bringing his salary up to $4080. Neither Contract Division nor your

Headquarters for our files.

3. Your attention is also directed to the "Terminal Payment"
clause. Under the provisions of the attached amendment, GERENDE is not
eligible for a termination settlement if he resigns from KUBARK. Only
in the event that we give him 30 days' notice of termination or fail to
renew his contract is he eligible for this termination payment. Your
comments on the stipulations as written into the attached amendment are
requested. In the event you feel that GERENDE should be entitled to a
termination payment should he resign his position, the clause will be
rewritten.

4. The attached amendment should be returned to Headquarters with
your comments and a copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: Contract for GERENDE

In reviewing the last contract amendment, it came to note
that CPD was deleting the original compensation figure of $3600
instead of the figure sent by the Station which was $4080. In
checking this out, we find that we have no copy or notification
of the amendment dated 1 September 1957 increasing his salary
from $3600 to $4080. CPD is rewritting the contract without
using a compensation figure for the amount to be deleted.

When we send this to the field, ask them to send us a copy
of the contract amendment, dated 1 September 1957. Also inform
them that they are to execute and retain the original copy of this
new contract amendment. It may be well to point out that Subject's
termination clause stipulates that he will received this benefit
only if we terminate the contract.
