THE PRESIDENT’S
INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST

ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

21 NOVEMBER 1963
TOP SECRET

13-00000

1. Iraq
    a. The new 21-man cabinet appears to be a coalition of Arab nationalist elements including four members of the moderate wing of the Baath Party. The regime is still dominated by the military, with eight cabinet posts.
    b. The new prime minister, Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the Baath Party, and both the Baathists and the Egyptians feel they can trust him.
    c. The political affiliation of eight of the new ministers is not known, but the key interior post is in the hands of an anti-Baathist nationalist.

2. Indonesia
    a. Defense Minister Nasution has been ordered by Sukarno to make conciliatory statements on Malaysia while on his trip abroad.
    b. The Dutch chargé who reported this explained that Nasution was chosen for this job because Sukarno was irritated with the ultra-tough line the defense minister has taken.

(Cont'd)

13-00000

c. The chargé has no information on the motives behind this switch. Our embassy thinks it may be a move to pave the way for exploratory talks by Foreign Minister Subandrio at Bangkok with his Thai and Philippine counterparts. It may also be meant to provide a more receptive attitude for Nasution's visit here.
d. Our embassy thinks Nasution went in for his Malaysia sabre rattling on Sukarno's orders, or at the very least, with the president's tacit support. Sukarno may feel Nasution has stolen some of his thunder.

3. Congo
    a. Adoula still did not get around to announcing the expulsion of all Soviet and Czech embassy personnel yesterday. However, his people managed on Tuesday afternoon to corral and hog-tie the Soviet counselor and press attaché before they could eat-up all the incriminating papers in their possession.
    b. The Russians are now being held at Ndolo prison. The Congolese surete says the seized papers include, among other things, minutes of a "liberation committee" meeting of opposition politicians in Brazzaville, and a document showing Soviet payments to this group.

For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

4. Ethiopia-Congo
    c. The Belgian ambassador thinks these papers are probably genuine. He says the Russians have made the mistake of underrating the Congolese and have stumbled into a surete trap.
    d. The Congolese also picked up two Czech diplomats but have since released them. This morning they arrested the correspondent of the Soviet news agency.
    a. Haile Selassie is planning to withdraw all Ethiopian troops from the Congo in January, according to the commander of his ground forces.
    b. The two battalions of Ethiopians provide the guts of the UN operation. They had been slated to stay until June and are likely to be very difficult to replace.
    c. The Emperor reportedly ordered the withdrawal on grounds that the troops are urgently needed in Ethiopia, particularly in view of the Soviet military accord with Somalia.
    d. Our ambassador has asked to see the Emperor, as well as the prime minister and foreign minister, to press for reconsideration.

For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

5. Yemen
    a. Military activity has slackened but the stalemate continues.
    b. Egypt still has about 32,000 troops in Yemen, and Saudi Crown Prince Faysal believes Nasir will not withdraw any significant number of them before 4 January when the extension of the disengagement agreement expires.
    c. Faysal is preparing to resume aid to the royalists at that time; he is stockpiling quantities of arms and ammunition along the border.
    (Includes INTERCEPTS)

6. Turkey
    a. The opposition Justice Party, heir of the old Menderes regime, appears to have won a victory in Sunday's nationwide local elections on the basis of incomplete returns.
    b. The collapse of Prime Minister Inonu's coalition government appears increasingly likely. Though a new coalition may be formed, there will be considerable resistance to the retention of Inonu as prime minister.

(Cont'd)
For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

c. Justice Party members will be putting on pressure for early national parliamentary elections. However their party leaders do not believe the Turkish military, which ousted Menderes in 1960, would permit them to take over if they won new elections.
d. They will probably try to work out some rapprochement with the armed forces.

NOTES

A. Cuba The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over Cuba crashed while returning, about 40 miles north of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to the scene. An air rescue unit sighted an unopened parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash area. The pilot is presumed lost. There is no indication that the plane was attacked.

B. Berlin Local East German troops acting without higher authority appear to have been responsible for turning high powered searchlights on pilots taking off from West Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on 14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A message of 16 November instructed border guard elements to discontinue such acts. There have been no further incidents reported since.

C. Albania-USSR A Radio Tirana broadcast has accused Khrushchev of personally releasing Barghoorn for fear that Moscow's wheat deal with the US might collapse. The Albanians are on record as preferring to eat grass rather than to kowtow to the West, but they are not above eating Chinese wheat acquired from Western sources.

D. Iran-USSR The Soviet Union's timing seems to be off in Iran. Government sources have reported that a twin engined plane was shot down in Iranian territory yesterday by Soviet jet fighters who violated Iranian air space. The Iranians say that the plane was on a photographic mission in connection with the

E. Venezuela Police seem to have restored order in downtown Caracas, but terrorism continues elsewhere. The slum district of Caracas to which the terrorists retreated is under virtual martial law. Among other things, the Dupont paint warehouse at Maracaibo was set afire and totally destroyed.

F. World Peace Council The WPC meeting in Warsaw next Thursday may wind up in another free-for-all. The Chinese Communist delegation, although not intent on disrupting the conference, plans to attack the WPC president's report given to a committee meeting in Vienna last September. The Japanese delegates plan to give general support to the Chinese and will try to forestall a vote on the Moscow test ban treaty.

THE PRESIDENT’S
INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST

ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

20 NOVEMBER 1963
TOP SECRET

13-00000

1. Iraq-Syria
    a. Although sporadic gunfire continued through the night in Baghdad, the army is in control.
    b. Arif has plans to announce the make-up of his cabinet today. It will probably contain some "mild" Baathists.
    c. He permitted Syrian strongman Hafiz and Michel Aflaq, the founder of the Baath Party, who were caught in Baghdad by the coup, to fly back to Damascus yesterday after the Syrian radio suddenly stopped vilifying the newest Iraqi regime.
    d. Arif and his colleagues obviously hope to reach an understanding with the Syrian regime. We doubt very much if they are interested, however, in the meaningful political and military unity the previous regime was aiming for.
    e. An intercepted message indicates that Syrian army units, now in Iraq, are getting ready to go home.
    f. The retention of Baathists in positions of power in Baghdad also tends to ease the threat to the party in Syria.
    (INTERCEPTS)

For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

2. Venezuela
    a. The Communist effort to frustrate the presidential election (1 December) continues.
    b. An illegal transmitter was heard yesterday in Caracas calling for a 48-hour general strike and urging listeners to arm themselves against the Betancourt government.
    c. Roving bands of Communist-led terrorists sought to enforce the generally unsuccessful strike with gunfire. There were at least nine deaths (some reports go as high as 19). Guerrilla activity in rural areas is also being stepped up.
    d. The government has jailed an added 200 extremists in the wake of yesterday's violence and plans are afoot to detain 1,500 more.
    e. The army is being held in reserve in the Caracas area.
    (includes Intercepts)

3. South Vietnam
    a. Ton That Dinh, whom we had earlier identified as the least reliable of the generals' group, is trying to use his position as security minister to build himself an independent political base.

(Cont'd)
For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

b. He has been visiting provincial cities to "explain" the military takeover and receive expressions of loyalty. He has continued to spread the idea that the coup was largely his own doing.
c. Dinh has directed provincial chiefs to submit to him daily reports on local politics. (INTERCEPTS)
d. This is going on while other members of the regime are squabbling about who should be in the "council of sages" and what it should do.

4. France-Israel
    a. We have picked up further details on the surface-to-surface missile system which a French firm is developing for the Israelis.
    b. The firm, Marcel Dassault, is to produce and test fire 25 missiles between July 1964 and July 1965. An actual production contract for perhaps 250 missiles will be drawn up late in the period if all goes well.

(Cont'd)
For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

c. Design requirements call for the delivery of a 1,600-pound warhead to a maximum range of 300 miles with a CEP slightly in excess of half a mile. A conventional warhead would not make military sense under these specifications.

5. Egypt
    a. Pamphlets and posters bitterly lampooning Nasir, especially for his involvement in Yemen and Algeria, have appeared on the streets of Cairo and Suez.
    b. Such public expression of anti-Nasir sentiment is highly unusual.
    c. It is still in a very low key, however, and there is no sign of organized opposition.
    d. We do not consider Nasir to be in any immediate danger of overthrow, though he could be forced to modify unpopular policies if the discontent spreads.

For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

6. Bolivia
    a. The return last week of Vice President Lechin, who has been on ice as Bolivia's ambassador in Rome, will heat things up in La Paz.
    b. The city has already witnessed four minor demonstrations which Embassy La Paz attributes to left-wingers encouraged by Lechin's presence.
    c. Lechin, who has ambitions to replace President Paz, intends to tour the country to rally his political forces, now in disarray as a result of some astute moves by Paz.
    d. If Lechin decides after these soundings to come out openly against the president, he will try to arrange a series of strikes early next year to point up his strength.

7. Cambodia
    a. Sihanouk may have finally painted himself into a corner on US aid.
    b. He has followed up yesterday's emotional public renunciation with an official request to our embassy for talks on the subject.

(Cont'd)
For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

c. We are always reluctant to predict just what Sihanouk will do next, but he may hope, perhaps expect, that the US will press him to retain some of our aid, even on his terms.

For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

NOTES

A. Congo A clandestine source tells us that Adoula will finally announce this morning the expulsion of all personnel of the Soviet and Czech embassies. This move has been hanging fire ever since security officials turned up evidence several weeks ago implicating personnel of these embassies in anti-government activities. The Congolese ambassador in Moscow has been directed to destroy his classified files.

B. USSR A new series of extended range missile tests seems to be upcoming. Three Soviet range instrumentation ships left Petropavlovsk nine days ago and are apparently headed for the more distant Pacific impact area, 6,500 miles from Tyuratam. There has so far been no announcement closing the area. (INTERCEPTS)

C. Sino-Soviet Peiping has been quick to exploit the opening provided by Barghoorn's release. To the Chinese this affair is an object lesson in how Khrushchev knuckles under to US pressure without getting a thing in return.

D. USSR-Cuba The five passenger ships we mentioned in last Thursday's Checklist have docked and departed. Some of them brought in rotational troops and all of them took out Soviet personnel. We cannot strike a firm balance on the basis of the evidence we now have, but it is possible that as many Soviets went out as came in.

For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

E. Czechoslovakia-Mali We have an intercepted message from the Malian ambassador in Prague reporting incidents between Czechs and Malians a week ago Sunday. There were, the ambassador notes, "only six wounded on the Malian side." (INTERCEPT)

F. Japan Ikeda does not appear to be in any particular trouble in tomorrow's elections. The long-range trend toward the left in popular vote will probably be apparent, but Ikeda's Liberal Democratic Party should retain a safe majority in the next Diet. The leftists have tried to turn rising prices and last week's twin disasters into election ammunition, but without marked success.

G. Indonesia Djakarta is trying to round up support for making Sukarno's little Olympics, the "Games of the New Emerging Forces," a permanent thing. In making a pitch along these lines to the Philippine official admitted that Djakarta views this sort of athletic competition as a means of achieving political ends. (INTERCEPTS)

H. Israel The Israeli foreign office says Ben Gurion is denying the Sulzberger account in last Saturday's New York Times of Ben Gurion's "hints" about experiments in "military atomics" at Dimona. Ambassador Barbour is not entirely convinced of this, however, and recalls Ben Gurion's oft-expressed opinion that it does no harm to let Nasir worry about Dimona.

I. Brazil A new round of army promotions and shifts in command are due to be announced Monday. Anti-Goulart elements fear, probably with good reason, that their ranks will be further thinned. Congenital plotters on the far right are talking coup yet again.

THE PRESIDENT'S INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST--22 NOVEMBER 1963

1. USSR:
    A. "GRIFFON", THE SOVIET ANTIMISSILE DISPLAYED IN THE 7 NOVEMBER MOSCOW PARADE, APPEARS DESIGNED ONLY FOR USE WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE.
    B. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF PHOTOS OF THE MISSILE INDICATES IT WEIGHS ABOUT 2,000 POUNDS LESS, AND HAS LESS THRUST THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED.
    C. ITS PROBABLE BEST PERFORMANCE ALTITUDES ARE FROM 50,000 TO 100,000 FEET, AND IT IS NOT THEREFORE COMPARABLE TO THE HIGHER THRUST NIKE-ZEUS SYSTEM.

2. CAMBODIA:
    A. SIHANOUK HAS GIVEN THE FRENCH IN PHNOM PENH FOREWARNING THAT HE PLANS TO REVIVE HIS NEUTRALITY GUARANTEE PROPOSALS.
    B. HE WANTS THE TWELVE GENEVA CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS TO MEET IN SOME ASIAN CITY, "AT THE GREAT POWERS' EXPENSE," TO WORK OUT A NEUTRALITY GUARANTEE DECLARATION.
    C. THE FRENCH SAY THEY PLAN TO RESPOND FAVORABLY AND HOPE WE WILL TOO, LEST SIHANOUK OTHERWISE TAKE THE FINAL IRREVOCABLE STEP INTO THE COMMUNIST BLOC.

E. MINISTER OF DEFENSE LON NOL HAS INTIMATED TO GENERAL TABER THAT THE CAMBODIAN MILITARY DOES NOT APPROVE OF TERMINATION OF US AID. CAMBODIAN MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE MADE IT PLAIN THAT THE US RETAINS A RESERVOIR OF GOOD WILL WITHIN THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY.

3. NOTES:
    A. CUBA-US: A PRENSA LATINA ITEM YESTERDAY DATELINED NEW YORK, SAYS THE STUDENT COMMITTEE FOR TRAVEL TO CUBA HAS STARTED ORGANIZING ANOTHER TRIP, HOPEFULLY TO INCLUDE AS MANY AS 500 STUDENTS THIS TIME. OVER 100 ARE SAID TO HAVE APPLIED SO FAR.
    B. U-2 CRASH: SALVAGE OPERATIONS CONTINUE ON THE WRECKAGE OF THE U-2. THERE IS STILL NO TRACE OF THE PILOT, CAPTAIN HYDE, WHO EVIDENTLY EJECTED SOMETIME BEFORE IMPACT.
    C.

D. JAPAN YESTERDAY'S JAPANESE ELECTION DID NOT CHANGE THE GENERAL BALANCE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES AND SOCIALISTS IN THE DIET. WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY TO MAKE A DETAILED ANALYSIS, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IKEDA'S POSITION WITHIN THE PARTY MAY BE SOMEWHAT LESS SECURE. THE SOCIALISTS GAINED A FEW SEATS, BUT FELL SHORT OF THEIR GOAL OF BREAKING THE "ONE-THIRD BARRIER."

E. INDONESIA-US: INDONESIAN OFFICIALS ARE LETTING IT BE KNOWN INDIRECTLY, VIA THE OIL COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES, THAT SUKARNO MAY WELL HOLD UP SIGNATURE OF THE LAW RATIFYING OIL CONTRACTS WITH THE BIG THREE UNTIL THE US POSITION ON AID TO INDONESIA IS "CLARIFIED." US AID THEY SAY WAS PROMISED BY WILSON WYATT AS PART OF A "PACKAGE DEAL" FOR SETTLING WITH THE OIL COMPANIES.

INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST

23 NOVEMBER 1963

13-00000

1. South Vietnam
    a. Vietnamese Communist efforts to discredit the new Saigon regime stayed in high gear this week.
    b. The number of armed attacks was off from the high of the previous week but still some 50% above the year's weekly average.
    c. These attacks have been, for the most part, small-scale efforts directed against the government's paramilitary forces in the villages. They have been designed more for their psychological impact than for immediate military gain.
    d. A high volume of messages on Viet Cong military and political communications nets indicates a probable continuation of this effort.
    e. The new government is responding by stepping up its own military operations. It is also setting about the hard job of revamping the Diem government apparatus and harnessing broader popular support for the war effort.
    f. The generals have been dealing fairly effectively with

their new responsibilities. There are, however, a few signs of dissension within this group and between it and civilian politicians.
g. One of the more ambitious and troublesome figures is the able but opportunistic General Ton That Dinh, the new Minister of Security. He has been travelling about the country spreading the idea that the coup was largely his doing and seems bent on developing his own independent base of power. He is a man to watch.
h. The new regime has also embarked on a purge of high military officers who sided with Diem during the Buddhist crisis and failed to get on the right side soon enough. (INTERCEPTS)

2. Venezuela
    a. The death toll from the terrorist outburst in Caracas last Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at about 30.
    b. This is the high water mark thus far in the campaign of the Castro-supported Communist extremists to disrupt the national elections a week from tomorrow.

(Cont'd)
For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

c. The Betancourt government has struck back hard. Its new unified command over the security forces, set up at US urging, passed this initial test with flying colors.
d. At least 500 extremists were arrested and the round-up is still going on. Their removal will hamper the Communist drive against elections in major cities like Caracas.
e. We now expect the elections to be held on schedule, a considerable achievement under the circumstances. The elections will be followed, however, by a Communist effort to prevent the March inauguration of the victor.
f. The rub here is that none of the presidential candidates commands President Betancourt's considerable assets for dealing successfully with the harsh realities of Venezuelan politics. The constitution prevents Betancourt from succeeding himself.
g. In the background, as always, looms the military, which could intervene if the president-elect shows signs of being soft on communism.

3. USSR-Cuba
    a. In the past week we intercepted Cuban military messages which show that Cuban interpreters are now posted at several surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites on the island.
    b. We think this means that on-site training of Cubans has begun on schedule. Field training is to last six months, after which the SAM system may be turned over to Castro.
    c. In the past month some 1,500 Soviets arrived in Cuba. Most of these were probably SAM experts, sent to monitor the training.
    d. Prior to their coming, we had detected no more than a few hundred Soviet military personnel entering Cuba since the October crisis last year.
    e. We estimate that at least 15,000, and probably closer to 18,000, have been withdrawn in the intervening 13 months, leaving, very roughly, 4,000 to 7,000. Those remaining are for the most part advisors whose main functions are to train and supervise Cubans in the use of weapons turned over to them.

4. Berlin
    a. We have had an indication that Soviet harassment of Allied access routes to West Berlin will shift this weekend to the air corridors.
    b. The Soviet man at the Berlin air traffic control center told the Allied representatives yesterday that Soviet transports would be using the air corridors for brief flights during the next five weekends.
    c. Moscow has tried on a number of past occasions to assert its right to restrict Allied use of the air corridors. In early 1962, the Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks" of air space for their own use. They have since demanded that Western flights stay between stipulated altitudes, that we file flight plans in advance and provide prior notice of border-crossing times.

5. Iraq-Syria-UAR
    d. This sort of harassment stopped in the spring of 1962 when Soviet leaders became convinced that the US was interested in a serious discussion of a Berlin settlement. Moscow may hope that the threat of more of this sort of harassment will jog the US into talks on Berlin.
    a. It now appears that President Arif's role in last Monday's coup in Baghdad may have been virtually that of a bystander.
    b. According to our latest information, Arif was wakened early that morning and given five minutes to join up. Tahir Yahya, now prime minister, was reportedly the organizer.
    c. Whatever Arif's role may have been, the coup was primarily an effort by the Iraqi Army to curtail the activities of the extreme wing of the Baath Party. The Baath is an Arab nationalist political organization, active throughout the Arab world, which has been ruling Iraq and Syria.

(Cont'd)
For The President Only - Top Secret

13-00000

d. The coup group has not thrown all Baathists out of the government; there are party members in the new cabinet.
e. Syrian Baathists have welcomed this retention of their Iraqi brothers. Their attitude springs from the recognition that the Baath in Syria cannot stay afloat without support from Iraq. Even so, we hear talk of coup plotting in Damascus.
f. The reaction of Nasir's Egypt, which passionately desires to see the Baath go under, has been exactly the opposite. Cairo has been backing off its all-out support for the coup ever since the new cabinet was announced.

SOVIET EXTENDED RANGE IMPACT AREAS

NOTES

A. USSR New activity involving Soviet range instrumentation ships in the Pacific appears to be forthcoming. Three instrumentation ships left Petropavlovsk 12 days ago and are apparently headed for the more distant Pacific impact area, 6,500 miles from Tyuratam. We are looking for extended range ICBM tests but we do not exclude a space event. There has so far been no announcement closing the area. (INTERCEPTS)

B. Congo-USSR Soviet embassy personnel have not yet left Leopoldville, but their departure is expected momentarily. They were ordered out of the country after the Congolese turned up good documentary evidence of their complicity in anti-government plots. One of the items taken off a Soviet diplomat the other day was a letter from an anti-Adoula leader now in Brazzaville asking for funds and arms to overthrow the Leopoldville government.

C. Britain The Labor Party scored again in the Dundee West by-election Thursday, increasing its 1959 majority of 719 to a thumping 4,955. Heartened by this, Labor is now pushing for general elections at once. Prime Minister Home is not likely to accede.

D. Ecuador The military junta which has run Ecuador since July may be about to come unstuck. We have a report that one of the less savory members of the group, air force Colonel Freiles, will try to take over full control this weekend. We are not sure of the reliability of this report, but Freiles is known to have been making motions in this direction.

E. Thailand Prime Minister Sarit, who suffers from an incurable liver disease, is failing. Doctors attending him, including one of our own, give him no more than six months more. Sarit has attempted to arrange for an orderly succession when he does go. The chances of this are not good; Thai politicians and military figures are already jostling one another for position.

F. USSR Cosmos 22, launched a week ago, was recovered yesterday. It is the eleventh unmanned satellite to be recovered. All recoverable satellites have been launched from Tyuratam, the main Soviet missile test center, and recovered after three to ten days aloft. A series of non-recoverable satellites has been fired from Kapustin Yar. (See Chart) (INTERCEPTS)
