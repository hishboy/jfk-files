1. FYI, SENIOR KUDOVE OFFICIALS ONLY, A STRIKE FORCE OF CUBAN REVOLUTIONARIES
HUNGERING 1200, INVADED CUBA BY SEA 17 APRIL AT COCHINOS BAY, LAS VILLAS PROVINCE.
AFTER THREE INITIAL BEACH HEADS WERE SECURED AGAINST LITTLE OPPOSITION, THE GOC
SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING AIR SUPERIORITY USING T-33 JET TRAINERS AND MIGs.
BY 18 APRIL UP TO 12 SOVIET-BUILT TANKS WERE BROUGHT INTO ACTION.

2. THE REBELS LOST ONE BEACH HEAD ON 17 APRIL AND THEIR REMAINING FOOTHOLD
ON 19 APRIL. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THREE FACTORS:

(A) INABILITY TO RESUPPLY WITH PROP A/C IN FACE OF ENEMY JET AIR -
SUPERIORITY.

(B) INABILITY TO WITHSTAND HEAVY TANK ASSAULT ON A BEACH COMBAT ZONE.

(C) OVERWHELMING ENEMY MANPOWER.

3. THIS STRIKE FORCE WAS THE MAIN REBEL EFFORT DURING THE PERIOD 16-20 APRIL.

4. NO RELIABLE DATA THIS DATE ON REBEL WOUNDED, CAPTURED, OR KILLED. BEACH
HEAD WAS COMPLETELY OVERRUN BUT LOCAL TERMATH SUCH THAT INDIVIDUALS OR SMALL
GROUPS MAY HAVE INFILTRATED INLAND.

5. 000 POLICE ACTION, INCLUDING ARREST OF TROUBLEMAKERS, EFFECTIVELY PREVENTED
CIVILIAN ACTION IN SUPPORT INVASION.
