Political Prisoner in Hospital

Clémard Joseph Charles was taken from the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince to Haiti's General Hospital. The former Duvalier banker has been jailed since 1970 for political reasons. No proper trial was held.

Mr. Charles is suffering from an acute liver infection and the physicians attending him have warned that he will die unless he's allowed to travel abroad for special treatment.

This isn't the first time Mr. Charles was taken from his cell to a hospital. Last year he was rushed to Haiti's military hospital for treatment of the same disease.

Mrs. Charles has been allowed to visit her husband.

This is the first time the Duvalier regime has acted half humanely with a political prisoner. It's been pointed out that Marie-Denise Duvalier Dominique, a friend of Mr. Charles, has often interceded for him.

Army chief-of-staff Jean-Baptiste Hilaire will soon be replaced, say military sources in Port-au-Prince.

His likely replacement? Col. Roger St. Alain.

On a lighter note, the General ran for cover on September 22 while there was a review on the Palace grounds to commemorate Duvalier's "election" in 1957. Accidentally the loaded automatic weapon of a militiaman went off. Many officials, General Hilaire among them, scrambled for protection. Jean-Claude, his mother and their bodyguard General Gracia Jacques were trembling, but they kept standing, says a source that was standing close to them.

SUBJECT Transfer of Political Prisoner Clemard Joseph Charles to Port-au-Prince General Hospital.

ACQ 15 October 1974

FIELD NO.

SOURCE A reliable source from a Haitian exile leader who is well educated and who has a wide variety of contacts in Haitian exile groups. The exile was aware that his information would reach the U.S. Government.

1. Clemard Joseph Charles, former president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti who has been held political prisoner since April 1970 on charges of plotting against the government, was recently transferred from jail to the general hospital in Port-au-Prince. Charles is said to be dying of cirrhosis of the liver and was transferred to the hospital on orders of Madame Simone Ovide Duvalier, mother of Haitian President Jean Claude Duvalier.

2. Doctors recommended that Charles be sent abroad for proper medical treatment but Mme. Duvalier authorized his transfer only to the local hospital. According to close relatives, this occurred only after Minister of Interior and Defense Paul Blanchet told the President and his mother that he would refuse to become involved in this case and would not sign any papers required of him as Minister of Interior certifying that Charles had died in prison. Relatives of Charles still intend to press for his removal from the country.

3. Field Dissem: Sent to Port-au-Prince.

SOURCE A YOUNG HAITIAN EXILE LEADER WHO IS WELL EDUCATED AND WHO HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTACTS IN HAITIAN EXILE GROUPS. HIS REPORTING HAS BEEN RELIABLE.

1. ON APPROXIMATELY 20 MARCH 1972 LUCKNER CAMBRONNE, HAITIAN MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE, TELEPHONED FERMIN JOSEPH, AN OFFICIAL OF THE NEW YORK-BASED, HAITIAN EXILE NEWSPAPER "HAITI OBSERVATEUR," AND TOLD JOSEPH THAT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OF HAITI (GOH) STANCE TAKEN BY THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" IN GENERAL AND JOSEPH IN PARTICULAR IN THE 18 MARCH EDITION OF THE PAPER.

2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE SAME SOURCE REPORTED IN TDCS-314/01942-72 THAT DURING A MEETING ON 16 MARCH 1972 BETWEEN THE TWO, CAMBRONNE TOLD JOSEPH THE GOH CONSIDERED THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" AND ITS SUPPORTERS TO BE THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE GOH'S PLANS TO REUNITE ALL HAITIANS IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD A NEW, PROGRESSIVE NATION. AS A FIRST STEP TO RAPPROCHEMENT, CAMBRONNE ASKED JOSEPH TO REALIGN HIMSELF WITH THE GOH AND RETURN TO HAITI. IF JOSEPH ACCEPTED, CAMBRONNE SAID, THE GOH WOULD BE WILLING TO NAME HIM TO WHATEVER OFFICIAL POSITION HE DESIRED EITHER INSIDE HAITI OR ABROAD.)

3. JOSEPH REPLIED THAT BEFORE HE OR THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" COULD GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO SOFTENING THEIR POSITIONS ON THE GOH, THE GOH WOULD HAVE TO SHOW ITS GOOD INTENTIONS THROUGH DEEDS RATHER THAN MERE PROMISES. CAMBRONNE THEN INVITED THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" TO SEND A TEAM OF REPORTERS TO HAITI TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES THE CHANGES WHICH WERE BEING BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE REGIME OF PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE DUVALIER. BEFORE SUCH A TRIP COULD BE MADE, JOSEPH SAID, POLITICAL PRISONERS WOULD HAVE TO BE RELEASED. ALSO,

THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" WOULD INSIST THAT ANY SUCH TEAM OF REPORTERS WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY NEWSMEN FROM OTHER NATIONS WHO WOULD ACT AS GUARDS AGAINST ANY PRESSURE THE GOH MIGHT APPLY AGAINST THE HAITIAN REPORTERS.

4. JOSEPH ASKED CAMBRONNE WHETHER THE GOH INDEED INTENDED TO RELEASE SUCH POLITICAL PRISONERS AS HUBERT LEGROS, CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES, AND COL. KESNER BLAIN AS CAMBRONNE HAD INTIMATED DURING HIS 15 MARCH PRESS CONFERENCE. TO THIS CAMBRONNE REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED LEGROS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS MAN AND THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF EVER RELEASING HIM. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: LEGROS, A LAWYER AND SELF-PROCLAIMED COMMUNIST, WAS ARRESTED IN MAY 1970 AFTER HAVING BEEN SOUGHT BY HAITIAN AUTHORITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. CHARLES, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI, AND BLAIN, FORMER COMMANDANT OF THE QUARTERMASTER CORPS, WERE ARRESTED IN APRIL 1970 FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE GOH.)

5. CAMBRONNE REITERATED THAT HE BELIEVED THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" POSED THE NUMBER ONE THREAT TO THE GOH'S PLANS TO REUNITE ALL HAITIANS. CAMBRONNE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOH ALSO BELIEVED GEORGES RIGAUD, A LEADER OF THE HAITIAN

2. RAYMOND SAID THAT, IN HIS INTERROGATION OF CHARLES, DUVALIER APPEARED PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH DETERMINING IF CHARLES HAD SERVED AS A FUNDING CHANNEL FROM AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN TO THE HAITIAN CONSPIRATORS. IN THE COURSE OF THE INTERROGATION, DUVALIER SHOWED CHARLES A PHOTOCOPY OF A CASHIER'S CHECK FOR $178,828 DRAWN IN CHARLES' BANK. CHARLES ALLEGEDLY REPLIED THAT HE HAD DEALINGS WITH MANY FOREIGNERS AND HAITIANS. HE DENIED DUVALIER'S CHARGES SAYING THAT, IF HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PURELY HAITIAN AFFAIR AND THAT HE WOULD NOT SULLY HAITI'S HONOR BY SEEKING HELP FROM FOREIGNERS.

3. ACCORDING TO RAYMOND, BLAIN ALSO DENIED ANY FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT. HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT ALL THE CABINET MEMBERS HAD CONSPIRED WITH HIM AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, EXCEPT FOR AURELE JOSEPH, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERIOR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE; MAX ASTOISE, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL AFFAIRS; AND ANDRE DUBE, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FINANCE AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS.
