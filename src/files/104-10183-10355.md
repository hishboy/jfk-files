Forwarded herewith is the most recent contact report from Henry S. PACHANKIS concerning AMMUG-1.

2. As indicated, PACHANKIS broke the bad news contained in Reference B on AMMUG-1's citizenship.
AMMUG-1 apparently took the news as well as could be expected.
Nevertheless, the Station would appreciate periodic notice on the status of AMMUG-1's case so we may keep him informed on any progress.

3. In regard to Reference C, PACHANKIS probed in the area of wife problems and never really resolved the situation.
PACHANKIS seemed to think, however, that the wife is still living with AMMUG-1.

SUBJECT Information from AMMUG-1 on Hector and Roberto RODRIGUEZ Llompart
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
Action Required: FYI
References: UFAA-1774

1. On 26 February when Henry S. PACHANKIS met with AMMUG-1 (201-749651) on his citizenship problem, information on the following two brothers was obtained:

2. Hector RODRIGUEZ Llompart (201-276598)
Cuban Ambassador to East Germany
Roberto RODRIGUEZ Llompart
CIT: Cuba
DOB: 22 October 1932
POB: Regla, Havana, Cuba
OCC: Government

This information was as follows:

3. AMMUG-1 was asked if he had anything new to report, He brought up a most interesting case, one which could prove to be a valuable lead.

b. AMMUG-1 has known the RODRIGUEZ family since his childhood in Regla (a small town across the bay from Havana).
The father had been a bolita banker during the Batista era.

c. AMMUG-1 was very friendly with RODRIGUEZ' two sons:
Roberto RODRIGUEZ Llompart
DPOB: c. 1934 in Regla, Havana, Cuba
Hector RODRIGUEZ Llompart

d. During the middle and late 1950s, Roberto had been a salesman for the Burroughs flour company and had stayed clear of the political picture in Cuba.

e. During the same period, Hector had been a student in the University of Havana, under Raul ROA, and had taken part in some revolutionary activities.
He had been arrested and beaten by the Batista police for his anti-government actions and his father had sent him into exile in the US.

f. When Castro came into power, the father was a potential "war criminal" for his illicit dealings.
AMMUG-1, who was in the police force in the initial stages of the revolution, states that he deleted an incriminating page from the father's dossier (showing he paid off the police to run his bolita operation) and thus saved him from prosecution.

g. AMMUG-1 continued to be close to the family, especially with Roberto, "whom I saw every day and ran around with."
Roberto never entertained the revolution.
As late as 1962-63, "We used to talk quite openly and frankly.
He was always against the revolution and the communists.
He worked in the Ministry of Industry because his brother got him the job, but he had only one idea in his head: to get out of Cuba and come to the US.
He was even plotting to get out by boat.
He had a US visa for many years and had visited here many times."

h. When AMMUG-1 defected, he lost contact with Roberto.
But, about two weeks ago a neighbor from Regla came to Miami on the Freedom Flights.
(COMMENT: This undoubtedly refers to Cuban refugee Segundo CASCUDO Gonzalez.
Reference forwarded the AMOT debriefing of CASCUDO on Roberto.)
When AMMUG-1 asked about Roberto, the neighbor said that he understood that Roberto, "was assigned in a foreign Embassy."
The refugee could not say what country Roberto was in.

i. This news prompts AMMUG-1 to comment: "This would be a most interesting person to talk to.
I don't think that he has changed his original way of thinking.
I believe he took the job to get out of Cuba, and because of the influence of his brother Hector.
I know he will talk to me and there is no telling what this man is capable of doing if someone approached him."

j. Roberto is (or was) married to:
Zulema (Inu)
DPOB: c. 1934 in Cuba
They had two children and the wife was even more anti-Castro than Roberto.

k. Hector, the other brother, was a rabid revolutionary when AMMUG-1 last saw him in c. 63-64.
He had joined the Castro bandwagon at the outset due to his revolutionary activities during the Batista era and his closeness to Raul ROA.
In c. 1960-61-62, Hector was closely aligned

with "Che" GUEVARA and served in his entourages, even on foreign junkets.
"He was very close to Che and traveled abroad a lot.
He and I were good friends - he used to bring me gifts when he returned from trips - but you couldn't even insinuate any opposition to the revolution, he was so fierce for it.
I hear that he is the Ambassador to Germany; I guess through his friendship with Raul ROA.
I doubt if he has changed, but I can talk to him in complete confidence - perhaps not like I could Roberto - but I could know how he thinks."

Since Roberto appears to be an excellent recruitment target, we will have him watchlisted with a view toward having AMMUG-1 make an approach to him at the first opportunity.
Although Hector appears far less vulnerable, we will consider an approach to him should he be transferred to a Free World country.

Please open a 201 file on Roberto.

ROBERTO ALWAYS TALKED AGAINST THE REVOLUTION AND COMMUNISTS.
HE HAD ONE PRINCIPAL IDEA - TO LEAVE CUBA AND GO TO STATES, EVEN BY BOAT.
AMMUG-1 DOES NOT BELIEVE HE COULD HAVE CHANGED AND ONLY HOLDS CURRENT GOC POSITION BECAUSE OF BROTHER, HECTOR (201-276598), WHO IS AMBASSADOR IN EAST GERMANY.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
THROUGH: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT: Vladimir RODRIGUEZ La Hera

1. This memorandum contains a recommendation in paragraph three for the approval of the DDCI.

2. Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera is a former Cuban national who defected to the United States in Nova Scotia, Canada on 21 April 1964.
At that time he was an intelligence officer in the General Directorate of Intelligence, the Cuban external intelligence agency.
He was brought to the United States under the provision of Section 7 of Public Law 110 (CIA Act of 1949).
He has never been a member of the Communist Party, but due to his service in the Cuban external intelligence organization he is not eligible to petition for naturalization until ten years after the date of his defection, or 1974.

3. Mr. RODRIGUEZ desires to become a naturalized U.S. citizen at the earliest possible time and has requested assistance from this Agency.
We request that a private bill be submitted to Congress waiving the ten-year provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act in his case, enabling him to become a U.S. citizen after five years of residence.
It is recommended that you authorize the Legislative Counsel to seek a private bill for RODRIGUEZ' relief.
