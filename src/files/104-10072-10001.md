FIELD INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY:
SUBJECT: Guatemalan Exile Activities
DATE: 14 January 1956
PLACE ACQUIRED: Costa Rica, (San Jose)
SOURCE, SOURCE EVALUATION, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT:
High level Central American exile (F). Appraisal of Content: Documentary.

On 14 January 1956 Col. Carlos PAZ Tejada, under the Col. Francisco COSENZA Galvez in Costa Rica for San Jose, addressed to the accommodation address ("Justo Marcin" Apartado Postal 2692) which is used by COSENZA, and is translated as follows:

"Although I have wanted very much to answer your letter of 7 December, many things have obstructed it and so time has slipped by again, against my wish, so that I have been able to write you only today.

"In spite of the latest news, which you must be familiar with, I really believe that what happened is nothing but an incident, natural to the trade. I really believe that the crazy one with whom we were dealing was trying to negotiate and participate in the winnings which there would be without much risk on his part. If the business failed for one reason or another, it does not signify anything more than a loss of time and some short-range hopes, but not in an important manner. Far from that. Something positive is being accomplished within a general line of forcing Maria Dolores to act in a manner which is good for us. I hope to continue in the activity and I have exactly the patience of a spider repairing its net in wait for a fly to fall into it.

"With relation to what you transcribed from Dona Tioha, that is due to the fact that the fat one who was formerly so close to me, has parted from me and has dedicated himself to the task of defaming me because he was unable to get something he wanted from me. Since he has nothing else to say, he says that I have very strange relations or that I belong to the comrades. As you will understand, this is nothing more than a disloyal mask, in which he is an expert. The friend who recently arrived from El Indio can increase your information concerning this. I have already written to the good friend of 'mi morena' so that he may explain if there is an opportunity. Although she is already really suffering a strong resistance in her activity, I do not think she will recuperate.

"I have strengthened the connections with Roquel and other friends of the

'finca mi morena'. I think that, depending on how things appear, we should activate our requests and also contemplate new solutions to the large problem. I am writing today to the farm to maintain a continuity of action and to see if the prevailing circumstances can be taken advantage of and given a purpose.

"I consider it extremely important that we maintain ourselves in closer correspondence than up to now. I understand that it is I who have failed to answer you, but I hope that the explanation of the events are sufficient. Failing to do so would be to fail to show interest and would even result in everything becoming cold and paralysed for who knows how long.

"The big Carl Arrote me very affectionately. I think that the problems that they cause each other are completely negative and that they cause us to deviate from the only road which should be followed."
