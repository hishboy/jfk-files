At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held
with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.
Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me.

Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select
Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney
General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were
presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be
furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal
memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff request
the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative
the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROS.

Upon our return to the Bureau, Mr. Adams requested that the
Intelligence Division undertake an analysis of each of the summaries which
were attached to the Petersen report in order to make a damage assessment
based on factors that would affect current Bureau operations should they be
revealed to the Committee. He also requested that this information be
compiled and available to brief the Deputy Attorney General as to the
difficulties that would be involved upon disclosure.

SUBJECT: Reporting of Interviews with Congressional
Investigating Committees or their Staffs

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Principals

REFERENCE: My Memorandum to Addressees, 10 April 1975,
Subject: Community Aspects of Inputs to
Congressional Committees Investigating
Intelligence (USIB-D-27.10/1)

1. Reference memorandum reported establishment by the
Intelligence Community Staff of a registry for documentation
relating to the Congressional investigations, and furnished
you with a format for abstracts to be provided to the registry
on each formal input to a Select Committee. In addition to
having in the registry the abstracts or, as appropriate, the
actual papers submitted as documentation to a Select Committee,
it is important that we establish a method for reporting on
interviews. Accordingly, I am enclosing a proposed format
for abstracts to be used for reporting on interviews by
Congressional Committee members or staff with your personnel
which involve information on Community activities or which, in
your judgment, raise the possibility of follow-on queries else-
where concerning the functioning or activities of the Community.

2. There is no intent to intrude upon matters which are
properly each agency's organizational responsibility nor to
infringe upon employees' individual rights or security. The
interview abstract format does not provide for identification
of the person being interviewed. The "File Reference No."
entry is for your convenience to indicate where any supporting
documentation is located within your own filing system.

Reference Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memorandum of
4-2-75 to which the Intelligence Division placed an addendum dated
4-14-75 showing that Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President, had
requested that the Sergeants at Arms of the Senate and House of
Representatives keep the Bureau advised regarding checks made for
electronic listening devices in the offices of captioned Select Committees.
This was discussed on 4-23-75 by Inspector Bowers with
Senate Sergeant at Arms William Wannall and his Deputy, Robert Hough.
They were amenable to notifying us concerning the checks they make of
Senate Select Committee space and the offices of the Members of this
Committee. Hough was designated by Wannall to handle this matter.
Hough advised that the special Capitol Police unit had made a check
of Room S148 in the Capitol on that date (4-23-75) prior to a meeting
of the Senate Select Committee in that room and found nothing. Hough
stated they have received no requests whatever to make any checks of
the offices of individual Committee Members. He said he had discussed
this matter with William Miller, Staff Director of the Select Committee,
and Miller indicated it would be taken up with the Committee but he has
heard nothing further from him.
On 4-24-75 Bowers discussed this matter with Kenneth
Harding, Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives. Harding
stated he has had no requests for any checks of the Members' offices or
to Mr. J. B. Adams

consideration soon. Distribution of this letter will be made sometime

IN CONNECTION WITH WORK OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE SELECT
COMMITTEES, ITS REPRESENTATIVES MAY CONTACT YOUR OFFICE FOR
INFORMATION.
IN ONE RECENT INSTANCE, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SENATE
SELECT COMMITTEE TELEPHONICALLY INQUIRED AS TO IDENTITY OF SAC
IN A PARTICULAR OFFICE DURING 1970.
IN HANDLING SUCH INQUIRIES INSURE ESTABLISHING BONA FIDES
OF REPRESENTATIVE BY SHOW OF CREDENTIALS ON PERSONAL CONTACT OR,
IF TELEPHONIC CONTACT, BY TELEPHONING BACK TO COMMITTEE.
UNLESS INFORMATION IS OF A PUBLIC NATURE, AS IN THE INSTANCE
CITED ABOVE, OBTAIN FBIHQ CLEARANCE PRIOR TO SUPPLYING ANY
INFORMATION. FBIHQ MUST BE EXPEDITIOUSLY ADVISED OF ALL
COMMUNICATIONS.
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1-19-01 BY SPALM/RW
NOTE: Referenced teletype alerted field to work of the
Senate and House Select Committees and Bureau's handling of
its requests. Also, it pointed out FBI has pledged full coop-
eration with Committees. San Francisco teletype 5/14/75 advised
that on that day Lester B. Seidel, Investigator, Senate Select
Committee, telephonically sought and was furnished identities
of SACS in San Francisco in 1970. Seidel did not indicate
specific nature of his inquiries. Considering the publicity
being afforded the work of the Committee, it is not inconceivable
unauthorized persons may attempt to obtain information from
the FBI particularly at field level, under guise of one of the
Committees. It is therefore believed this teletype to all SACS
is desirable, as a cautionary measure.
