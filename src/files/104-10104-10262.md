MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of General Counsel
ATTENTION: Mr. John Greaney
SUBJECT: James Garrison

1. Per our conversation in the environs of the DD/P's office on 19 December, we have just received from [London] Station a scrap of information on Subject's activities. [MI-5], the [British] Security Service, has provided the following in a report on Americans who are in correspondence with the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation:

"Jim Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans, Louisiana

A secret and reliable source has reported that the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation has been in touch with Jim Garrison. Our source states that the initiative in this contact appears to have come from the Foundation and the purpose of it seems to be to persuade Garrison to write an article about the late President Kennedy's assassination which presumably the Foundation could use in some way."

2. [MI-5] has also passed this information to the Legal Attache (FBI representative) in [London.] I would stress that [MI-5's] source is very sensitive and request that this office be advised in advance if any executive action is to be taken on the basis of the above information.
