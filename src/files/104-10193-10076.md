years old, was said to have
been in charge of the agency's
efforts against Prime Minister
Fidel Castro of Cuba. He was
among 10 agents whose iden-
tities were disclosed by the
Senate Select Committee on In-
telligence after an investigation
in 1975 of alleged assassination
plots by the United States.
William E. Colby, then Direc-
tor of Central Intelligence, had
argued that disclosure of the
names of agents would 'put
them in jeopardy of retaliation
by "irrational groups."
Mr. Harvey testified before
the Senate committee that he
had been told by superiors that
the Castro assassination plot had
been approved at the highest
levels of the government, and
that he had discussed the ef-.
forts with his immediate super-
ior, Richard Helms, who later
became director of the agency.
Mr. Harvey moved to Indian-
apolis in 1969 after retiring
from the agency, where he had
worked for 22 years. He worked
for the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation from 1940 to 1947.

Notification of Designation as a Participant in
the Organization Retirement and Disability System

Action: As indicated
REF: Book Dispatch 5096 & 70183 - 7586

1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organisa-
tion Retirement and Disability System and have been so designated effective
21 November 1965.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably
by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the
individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designa-
tion adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement
may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An appeal
with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of
the date of this dispatch or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any
questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot
be answered by referring to book Dispatch 5096 should be forwarded to Head-
quarters.

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement system
are superior to the benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. How-
ever, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retire-
ment may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service system, because of this, the policy
decision has been made that a participant in the Organization system who
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil service system may, not later
than one year prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from cur system
and transferred to the Civil service system. Thus, you should not anticipate
this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation
as a participant adverse to your best interests.
