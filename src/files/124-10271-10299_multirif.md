DATE 1-11-01 BY SPALMIRY

At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held
with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.
Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and Mr.
O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select
Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney
General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were
presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be
furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal
memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff request
the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative
the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROs.

Upon our return to the Bureau, Mr. Adams requested that the
Intelligence Division undertake an analysis of each of the summaries which
were attached to the Petersen report in order to make a damage assessment
based on factors that would affect current Bureau operations should they be
revealed to the Committee. He also requested that this information be
compiled and available to brief the Deputy Attorney General as to the
difficulties that would be involved upon disclosure.

Honorable Charles E. Wiggins
NOTE:
The resolution of the State Bar of California (SBC)
referred to above did not identify the specific incident in
which they were interested so Congressman Wiggins' letter was
acknowledged and we indicated additional details would follow.
On 4/25/75 San Francisco advised the basis for the SBC resolution
was articles contained in the 2/7/75 issues of the San Francisco
Examiner and Oakland Tribune. In these articles Muse was not
mentioned by name but the details corresponded with his case.
On 4/28/75 Supervisor Ernest Wall, New Orleans, advised Muse
was identified by name in articles concerning this incident
in the 2/2/75 issue of the New Orleans Times Picayune and the
2/25/75 issue of the New Orleans States Item. Since Muse
revealed his relationship with the FBI and has been publicly
identified by name and appears to be no privacy issue or need
to protect the confidentiality of our files, Congressman Wiggins
should be advised of the complete details in this matter. As
the SBC urged issues such as this be considered by the select
committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, a
copy of this communication is being furnished for the information
of the Legal Analysis Section and Project Senstudy 75 in
Division 5.
