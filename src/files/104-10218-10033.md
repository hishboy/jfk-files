Viktor MARTYNOV

Age about 39-35. Not very tall. Rather French looking. He is a photographer for Novosti. Source met him through visitors from Paris Match, whom MARTYNOV makes a practice of guiding around town. He has never been stationed abroad but comes out to Paris once in a while. The next time he comes he will look up Source. He speaks very good French, and has a pleasing personality. He is rather outspoken at times. For instance, when someone said "bunch of stupid people" about the Soviets, MARTYNOV replied, "You're damn right." He appears to be tempted by western living. He concentrates on the French. He is married to a nice girl with brown hair and eyes. They have children, but Source is not sure whether one or two.

Vladimir ZAKHAROV

About 40 years old, he is the administrator of the Conservatory, and Source will see him in Paris when he next goes there. He speaks very good Spanish, having formerly been stationed in Buenos Aires as a cultural attaché or something. He is probably a KGB officer, but he works hard at his cover job. During a trip to Paris, he called Source's father to arrange for the quick renting of two pianos for the orchestra he was with. He looks like a frog and is rather bald, short, blond, with dark blue eyes. He is very friendly and accommodating, lively, and nice. He goes out a lot, and sees a lot of foreign colony, particularly Argentines and other Spanish speaking people. He is married and has a little boy called Emilyan. He once invited Source to go to his dacha, but she didn't have time. She intends to send him a postcard with her new address.

Valeriy Vadimovich LEDNEV

1. Subject, an IZVESTIYA correspondent, was identified as a good source of information for two American journalists in Moscow who were suspected of having been recruited by the KGB.

2. Although we have no record of his being stationed abroad, Subject has made several visits to non-bloc countries. In June-July he visited New Delhi and Bangkok. In December 1962 he visited Iran. While in Iran he was introduced as IZVESTIYA's special correspondent. He corrected the individual who was making the introduction by saying that he was an international observer.

3. Subject visited Turkey in April 1963. While in Ankara he is reported as having participated in "propaganda tactics" and made an "attempt to feel the pulse of the public" as part of the Soviet efforts at that time to establish closer relations with Turkey. During visits with various heads of mass media organs he commented that while in Iran he had written "friendly articles" which were well received by the Iranians. As a result he was the first Soviet journalist to be admitted to the oil regions of Abadan and Ahvas.

4. LEDNEV is described as tall, balding dark hair, high cheek bones, small mouth, wears clear plastic-rimmed glasses, smokes Kent cigarettes. He speaks English, but speaks better German.

Jose Antonio MENDIA, Counsellor (Cultural and Press) Argentine Embassy

He was chief correspondent of La Prensa in Paris and married a Frenchwoman. Source thinks he is a likely target of the KGB because he needs a lot of money. This is because his wife is very snobbish and ambitious and insists on buying quantities of expensive clothes.

MENDIA thinks he is shrewd, but he is not.

He had an affair with the ballerina PLISETSKAYA eight or nine years ago, while previously stationed in Moscow, and was kicked out of Moscow for it. However, he is now married, apparently happily, and has three children. He is a very bright and charming man who speaks Mongolian and Chinese. He is a cultural officer, but since these languages are rare among cultural officers, Source assumes that he is MI-6.

Ahmar MIRFENDERESKI, Iranian Ambassador

He is a very interesting character. His grandfather was Ambassador to Russia before the revolution, and he speaks extremely good Russian. He is a very sharp man who knows a lot of Soviets, and has excellent rapport with them because of his language and open manner. In his diplomatic pose, he doesn't seem to be anti-Soviet, but Source does not know his true feelings on that score. He is not anti-American, although he sometimes considers some American actions stupid. He is married, but his wife is often out of Moscow. He is able to stand a lot of liquor.

C.O. comment: AEPASSIVE stated that the Ambassador had some of his primary education in Russia and confirmed his expertise in the language and knowledgeability, but stated definitely that the ambassador is 100% anti-Soviet.

LUCCAN, Fau

A correspondent for an Italian paper, age about 42, who lives in Source's building. (Not listed Information Moscow). He has been in Moscow for at least ten years and is married to a Soviet woman. They have two children. His Soviet wife has a miserable life and never leaves the apartment. He is always out, hanging around the Hotel National bar, trying to make friends with businessmen and journalists. He is a crashing, insensitive, boor and bore. He drinks a lot and probably goes out with girls. He comes to a lot of cocktail parties without an invitation, always without his wife, whom Source has never seen. He has another wife in Italy, which causes him serious financial problems, but in spite of this he has a very expensive apartment. He speaks Russian, French, and English, and occasionally makes anti-Soviet remarks. Source is certain he is a KGB agent because of his Soviet wife, his need for money, his expensive apartment, and the way he operates in trying to make contacts and crash parties.

This man is about 55 and lived in China for a long time. He married a White Russian girl from Harbin. They left Shanghai in 1951, which Source considers strange, i.e. it would have been normal for them to leave in 1949 when the Communists took over. They have a son in the United States who is married, and possibly a daughter there as well. They have another daughter, unmarried, Svetlana TAKAHASHI, who lives in Japan. Source met her by chance at Orly airport and also in Moscow. She is a beautiful girl, half Japanese and half Russian. She speaks good Russian, as does her father.

America House Club

SOURCE comments this is little more than a brothel where the lower echelons of the foreign diplomatic colony arrange trysts. There is a great deal of passing whiskey and cigarettes here, particularly among the foreign service personnel (maids, etc) of members of the diplomatic corps. At least within the French embassy the general feeling is that one should stay away from the place, since no diplomats of status go there, except on rare occasions (an especially good film). The enlisted American military personnel are known to use the facilities of the club to shack up with foreigners.

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

The tone of the Club has improved greatly owing to security measures which have been introduced in controlling the people who may enter. It has now become chic and even ambassadors go there.

His wife is French. SOURCE sees them at a number of American and British parties. Frequently present at African parties, since he is embassy officer responsible for African affairs. Wife is a bore.

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

Source and her husband think LOGAN is an intelligence officer because the Soviets are very interested in him and publicized him as a spy for his interests in Africans in Moscow. After this article, the Africans stopped seeing LOGAN. He was very well liked however.

They are the most socially adept members of the US embassy. They entertain well and their parties are fun. They both dance well. She serves wonderful buffets. She is French. Has visited SOURCE's father in Paris on one occasion. SOURCE has had the Provenchers to her apartment about 15 times (since Oct 62). SOURCE speculates Provencher may be an intelligence officer based on the fact that he has "too good" an apartment for his rank and more care is taken of him than of Mr. Logan in the political section.

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

Source says her husband has changed his mind about PROVENCHER's being an intelligence officer. Possibly he is one, but not in Moscow.

Mr. Henry SHAPIRO

Position (Jan'65): Chief, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL Bureau in Moscow, USSR

SOURCE and SOURCE's husband like S. He is Jewish, sharp and quick, speaks excellent Russian. Knows a tremendous amount about Russian, very well informed. SOURCE speculates SHAPIRO may have helped the Russians in the past (she means the RIS) but does not think he has to now that he has established himself. SOURCE comments that SHAPIRO, like all Western press people have to be extremely careful what they file, otherwise they will be thrown out of the SU. This is very true in SHAPIRO's case, since he married to Soviet national who might not be able to leave with him if he were thrown out. Most notable thing about SHAPIRO is his very extensive contacts in the dip circuit - Henry literally knows everybody worth knowing. On very good terms with past US ambassador (Thompson). Probably because of religious bonds, he is also on very good terms with current Israeli ambassador.

DATE ACQUIRED : September 1966.

Shapiro hates to spend money. He is very hard on his assistants, and
