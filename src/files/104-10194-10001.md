MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
THROUGH:
SUBJECT: Request for Early Home Leave

1. In accordance with HR 20-30b(3), it is requested
that approval be granted for Tarasoff, Boris D. to be-
gin home leave short of tour.

2. Tarasoff, Boris D. has been in Mexico City
since 5 June 1963. He last returned from home leave on
13 January 1966 but because his wife's parents are in
very poor health, the Station has requested on his behalf
that the date of his home leave be advanced to 23 September
1967.

3. The Station and Tarasoff, Boris D. are aware of the re-
quirements to extend his next tour in Mexico City by the
number of days his present tour will be reduced.

4. Tarasoff, Boris D., a participant in the CIA Retirement
and Disability System, will reach mandatory retirement age
in November 1968. At that time he will be converted to
contract employee status in order that the Division may
retain his unique skills. (There is a continuing require-
ment for Tarasoff, Boris D.'s services as the Station's Russian and
Spanish translator which could not be met as effectively
by the utilization of other personnel.)

5. If this request is approved, please coordinate
on the attached cable to Mexico City.
