SUBJECT: LINERGO Report

The following paragraphs were extracted from a detailed report on the activities of Dr. Orlando BOSCH Avila, a Cuban medical doctor and head of the anti-Castro revolutionary organization, MIRR, and resident in the U.S.

On June 10, 1966, NY T-3 reported that BOSCH claimed to have told Roberto de los Rios, who is checking British flights used by Cuban United Nations personnel traveling from Gander, Pack A to New York, NY T-3 expressed the belief that this procedure is a preliminary survey to some form of action, possibly the bombing of a plane going from Nassau to Cuba with Cuban United Nations personnel expressed aboard.

On June 17, 1968, NY T-3 reported that BOSCH had declared that he intends to continue bombing ships of countries trading with Cuba. On June 18, 1968, BOSCH disclosed to NY T-3 that he knew of 10 men in New York City, Tampa and Miami who are carrying out MIRR's plan to bomb ships.

The ALGAIADUS PLASON on March Tutitted, Slatt5128, called and claimed that their target would be Punto Allegro, Cuba. Four to six bombs would be used. The raid would be within two. A twin engine airplane would be used. The flight would be out of Opa-Locka, Fla. and the pilot would receive between fifteen hundred and two thousand dollars.

A SECOND SOURCE, WHO HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH BOSCH IN THE PAST AND WITH WHOM INSUFFICIENT CONTACT HAS BEEN HAD TO DETERMINE HIS RELIABILITY, ON MARCH TWENTYNINE, SIXTYSEVEN, FURNISHED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.

ON FEBRUARY TWENTYTWO, SIXTYSEVEN AND MARCH TWELVE, SIXTY-SEVEN, BOSCH MET WITH AN AMERICAN PILOT CONCERNING A BOMBING MISSION OVER CUBA.

THE TARGET WOULD BE A SUGAR MILL ON THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA.

THIS SOURCE REPORTED THAT BOSCH IS VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS, WOULD NOT IDENTIFY THE CREW OF THE AIRPLANE, THE SOURCE OF THE BOMBS, & FROM WHERE IN THE UNITED STATES THE PLANE WOULD TAKE OFF.

BOSCH SAID HE WOULD CONTACT THE PILOT ON APRIL ONE, TWO THREE, SIXTYSEVEN, BRIEF HIM ON THE MISSION, FINALIZE ALL ARRANGEMENTS, AND THE PILOT WOULD BE READY TO LEAVE AFTER THE BRIEFING.

Afirmó Orlando Bosch que la CIA lo Alentó a Volar una Refineria

ORLANDO, Florida, Junio 4 (UPI) - Orlando Bosch afirmó ante el jurado en el juicio que se le sigue bajo el cargo de exportar armamento ilegalmente, que la Dirección Central de Inteligencia "CIA" alentó una conjura de tres exiliados cubanos para volar una refinería de petróleo en La Habana en 1965.

El acusado dijo a los abogados del gobierno que no intentaba infringir las leyes estadounidenses de neutralidad y exportación de armas, pues el plan fue ideado por la CIA.

Mientras acusadores señalan que Bosch fue advertido sobre las normas federales, sus defensores aducen que el Gobierno Federal proporcionó los materiales y había causado a Johnson.

El abogado defensor argumentó que la incursión no iba a ser realizada desde territorio de Estados Unidos, y que las bombas que debían utilizarse no estaban clasificadas como armamentos ilícitos.

Bosch, Marcos Rodriguez, José Diaz y Gerullo Gutiérrez, deberá culminar mañana con la entrega del caso a un tribunal de 13 hombres.
