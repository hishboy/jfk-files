REF: DIRECTOR 233355

WE BELIEVE THAT CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH AMAUTO-1 ALONE TOO DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE SINCE AMAUTO-1 IS FREQUENTLY IN COMPANY SOMEONE FROM HIS STAFF OR HAVING LUNCH WITH SPANISH OFFICIALS OR BUSINESSMEN. MOREOVER, ENCOUNTER UNDER THIS SITUATION, WE FEEL, WOULD NOT PERMIT RELAXED EXCHANGE BETWEEN SAMKO AND AMAUTO-1. WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVES:

A. ON ARRIVAL SPAIN VIA AERONAVES DE MEXICO FLIGHT 450 LEAVING MIAMI FRIDAY SAMKO WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO HOTEL OF STATION SELECTION. STATION OFFICER WILL ALSO OCCUPY HOTEL IN ALIAS AND INITIAL CONTACT WITH SAMKO WILL BE MADE IN HOTEL. CINCIDENTALLY, BELIEVE NO NEED PACHANKIS ACCOMPANY SAMKO TO MADRID.)

B. EARLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON SAMKO WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO AMAUTO-1'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE. HIS EXCUSE WILL BE THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO EMBASSY BUT WAS CERTAIN THAT EMBASSY WOULD BE CLOSED. IN ADDITION, SINCE SAMKO SCHEDULED TOUR OF MADRID AND SUBURBS LEAVING EARLY MONDAY MORNING DECIDED MAKE EFFORT CONTACT AMAUTO-1 AT HOME RATHER THAN POSSIBLY MISS OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIM. SAMKO WILL BE INSTRUCTED TO SIGN UP FOR TOUR OF CITY TO LEND AUTHENTICITY TO STORY. SAMKO WILL HAVE TO BE PREPARED REPLY TO INEVITABLE QUESTION FROM AMAUTO-1: HOW DID YOU FIND MY ADDRESS? SAMKO'S REPLY WOULD BE THAT HE OBTAINED ADDRESS FROM IBERIA EMPLOYEE AT AIRPORT WHO SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME TRYING TO LOCATE AMAUTO-1 RESIDENCE. (ADDRESS APPEARS IN DIP LIST AVAILABLE OVERTLY.) SAMKO WOULD FURTHER EXPLAIN, IF NECESSARY, THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW EMPLOYEE GOT ADDRESS, BUT KNOWS SHE MADE NUMBER OF TELEPHONE CALLS. WE CANNOT PREDICT AMAUTO-1'S REACTION TO THIS DIRECT APPROACH. HE MIGHT CLAIM PRESS OF BUSINESS OR OTHER COMMITMENTS THEREBY REFUSING SEE SAMKO IN HOME BUT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT SAMKO VISIT EMBASSY MONDAY MORNING. SAMKO SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SAY THAT IF THIS WOULD NOT EMBARRASS AMAUTO-1 HE WOULD GLADLY CANCEL YOUR TOUR.

PAGE 3 MADRID 1131 SECRET

THAT BECAUSE HE IS AMERICAN HE SHOULD NOT VISIT PBRUMEN EMBASSY, WOULD, WE FEEL, QUICKLY AROUSE AMAUTO-1'S SUSPICION. SAMKO'S APPROACH TO AMAUTO-1 RESIDENCE CAN BE MONITORED FROM HOMES OF TWO STAFFERS WHO LIVE WITHIN EYESHOT OF AMAUTO-1'S RESIDENCE.

C. AMAUTO-1'S PROBABLE SECOND QUESTION: HOW DID SAMKO KNOW HE WAS IN MADRID? REQUIRES MORE THOUGHT AND HELP FROM MIAMI. IDEALLY, SAMKO SHOULD BE ABLE SAY THAT A MUTUAL FRIEND OF BOTH AMAUTO-1 AND SAMKO WERE TOGETHER RECENTLY IN MIAMI AND AMAUTO-1'S NAME MENTIONED. SAMKO ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO AMAUTO-1 AND FRIEND DISCLOSED THAT

(IN 085476)

AMAUTO-1 NOW "AMBASSADOR" TO SPAIN. (SUBJECT WH/MIAMI 7595 MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE "FRIEND" WHOSE NAME SAMKO MIGHT USE. STATION SUGGESTS THAT CONTACT BE MADE WITH SUBJECT IN LOS ANGELES TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE KNOWS WHERE AMAUTO-1 IS. ALSO OBTAIN PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION, OCCUPATION IN LA AND PRIOR JOB IN MIAMI PLUS OTHER NOTABLE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH COULD BE USED AS FILLER BY SAMKO TO SHOW THAT POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN AMAUTO-1'S COUSIN AND SAMKO.) IN ADDITION, SUGGEST

PACHANKIS RE-CONTACT SAMKO TO ASCERTAIN NAMES OF PERSONS IN UNITED STATES WHO KNEW AMAUTO-1 AND FROM WHOM SAMKO OSTENSIBLY MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION OF AMAUTO-1'S MADRID ASSIGNMENT. WELCOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS AS REPLY TO ABOVE QUESTION.

2. LINE SAMKO WOULD TAKE AFTER FOOT IN DOOR SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY REHEARSED IN MIAMI BEFORE ARRIVAL MADRID BECAUSE OF 01- ELEMENT A MIAMI SHOULD CABLE WHAT SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ARE GIVEN TO SAMKO SO THAT STATION OFFICER COMPLETELY AWARE OF HOW SAMKO IS TO CONDUCT HIMSELF.

3. IN VIEW DESIRE TO INITIATE CONTACT BEFORE AMAUTO-1'S JUNE DEPARTURE SUGGEST CONTACT ABOVE PERSONS ASAP.

2. (FIELD COMMENT: ACCORDING TO ANOTHER UNTESTED SOURCE WHO WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE 4 MAY INCIDENT, THE CROWD INCLUDED 23 MEMBERS OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND A NUMBER OF CUBAN EXPATRIATES MEETING AN IBERIA FLIGHT FROM HAVANA WHICH WAS CARRYING 75 CUBAN OFFICIALS AND 30 CUBAN REFUGEES. MAXIMO TORRES, FORMER MAYOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA AND A MAN OF OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, ADDRESSED ONE OF THE ARRIVING CUBAN OFFICIALS, MISTAKING HIM FOR A REFUGEE. THE OFFICIAL REBUFFED HIM RUDELY AND A GENERAL ARGUMENT ENSUED AND BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED. HORACIO FUENTES MARTINEZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY, JUMPED FROM A NEARBY CAR AND PISTOL-WHIPPED ONE OF THE REFUGEES. AFTER THE POLICE ARRIVED, TORRES AND HIS WIFE NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION.)

3. ON 5 MAY, ROBERTO FRANCO OLIVA, CUBAN CONSUL IN MADRID, COMPLAINED TO A SPANISH POLICE INSPECTOR CONCERNING THE INCIDENT AT THE AIRPORT AS FOLLOWS:

A. THE SCENE AT THE AIRPORT HAD BEEN PREPARED BY THE U.S. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) AND COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES." THE INSPECTOR REPLIED TO THIS THAT SPANISH AUTHORITIES WERE

FOR THEIR PART, THE REFUGEES HAD SAID THAT HORACIO FUENTES HAD PULLED OUT A GUN DURING THE FIGHT, A CHARGE WHICH FRANCO DENIED AT LENGTH.

B. MANY OTHER ATTACKS HAVE BEEN SUFFERED BY CUBAN OFFICIALS AT THE AIRPORT AND DAMAGE DONE TO THEIR PARKED CARS.

C. WHEN CUBAN SEAMEN ARE ARRESTED BY THE SPANISH POLICE IN THE CANARY ISLANDS THEY ARE INTERROGATED SEPARATELY IN THE POLICE STATION BY AN AGENT OF THE CIA WHO IS A CUBAN "GUSANO" (TURNCOAT).

D. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SPANISH REPUBLICANS AND SPANISH COMMUNISTS IN CUBA, THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA IS NEVER MOLESTED.

E. FRANCO IS PREPARED TO ADVISE CUBAN PASSENGERS COMING TO SPAIN TO CARRY RAZORS FOR SELF DEFENSE. CUBAN OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO GO TO THE AIRPORT, SHOULD APPLY FOR LICENSES TO CARRY PISTOLS.

1. VIEW REF A, HQS SANGUINE ABOUT POSSIBILITIES OF "CHANCE" APPROACH BY SAMKO TO AMAUTO-1. AS REASONABLY WELL OFF RETIRED PERSON, SAMKO COULD NATURALLY GO TO MADRID AS TOURIST. HQS WONDERS WHETHER THIS WOULD HOLD WATER UNLESS WIFE ACCOMPANIED HIM. MIAMI INVESTIGATE THIS POINT.

2. APPROACH BY SAMKO WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAD TO RECRUITMENT, BUT WOULD OFFER PERSONAL READING OF AMAUTO-1 BASED ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE WARM ENTREE PROVIDED BY FONDLY-REMEMBERED IN PAST ASSOCIATION. IF APPROPRIATE, SAMKO COULD PROVIDE LINK TO "OTHER WORLD" IN CASE AMAUTO-1 EVER NEEDED HELP. LATTER SCHEDULED TRAVEL HAVANA IN JUNE 70 AND RETURN MADRID PRIOR POSTING CUBA. JUDGING FROM AMBEDEW-1 AND AMDELAY-1 CASES, BRIEF RETURN TO CUBA MIGHT PROVE TURNING POINT IN ANY DECISION TO DEFECT. THEREFORE, ANY MEETING WITH SAMKO SHOULD BE PRIOR JUNE DEPARTURE.

1. The following information about Subject's trip to Spain and her activities while here was obtained from QUTIMID and QUDOZE.

2. Subject arrived in Madrid on 10 February 1970. She traveled to Barcelona during the week of 23 February and returned to Madrid 6 March whereupon she then left for Portugal. She returned to Madrid on 17 March and waited for Guillermo RUIZ Perez' return from the Spanish/Cuban Commercial negotiations in Cuba. Sonia departed Madrid for Cuba on 27 March 1970. It appears that she intended to travel to Vienna, Austria next, since several cables were sent to Vienna from Madrid advising Sonia's travel status. During her stay in Spain, Sonia was in frequent contact with one Jose Agustin GOYTISOLO, Spanish writer in Barcelona, telephone 228-4063 (Station traces are OSBA 02385, 17 February 1965; OSBA 02718, 11 August 1967; and OSBA 02795, 1 March 1968). She was not known to have been in contact with any other locals and what little time she had for diversion she spent with the mission officers and their wives.

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

3. The purpose of Sonia's trip to Madrid was to discuss the 1970 work plan for the Embassy with the Charge, Guillermo RUIZ Perez. She also talked with the various Embassy officials, most probably to familiarize herself with their duties and to see if they had any problems. She pitched in and helped with the backlogged work of Orestes BARREDA and Horacio FUENTES and also helped with the cultural activities. For instance, she sent two cables to MINREX - one regarding the forwarding of movie posters for a March exhibit and another regarding the forwarding of a Cuban stamp exhibition by end March.

4. In their discussion of the 1970 work plan Sonia told RUIZ that they were going to plan the February, March, and April quarter. She showed him "an agenda for the control of planned and unplanned activities" and the general directives of the plan which included scientific information and political information, with specific directives (requirements) for Spain. RUIZ has to prepare for Havana a monthly report, then a quarterly summary, of the activities accomplished. Based on these reports the activities of the following quarter will be planned.

a. In line with the plan of scientific information, Sonia and RUIZ discussed the pros and cons of a Comite Cientifico-Tecnico which is to be set up in Madrid. RUIZ was of the opinion that the local (Spanish) Communist Party would try to infiltrate it and this would bring problems to the Embassy. Sonia pointed out the successes encountered in Switzerland and Sweden with such a committee even though at first there were problems which were later overcome.

b. Sonia showed RUIZ a commercial project which she planned to take to Portugal and asked him to read it because it was also of interest to the Cuban mission in Spain.

c. Sonia mentioned that the Plan of Information was still to be completed especially in the priority categories of livestock and economy.

d. They turned next to the topic of the budget. Sonia said that the budget for each mission had to be submitted before the end of April (every year) and no additional expenditures could be submitted for approval during the course of the year. Spain, Canada, and France, however, would be treated individually. Their special needs, such as acquisition of more office space, raises in cost of living allowances, etc., would be taken into consideration at any time.

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

SECRET

5. During their various discussions RUIZ aired his complaint about the Visa Department in Havana saying that the department was practically worthless and that last year 76 cables regarding visas remained unanswered. Sonia defended the Ministry saying that it had a lot of work to do, but RUIZ replied that they wanted to work only 8 hours a day. They also discussed the scholarship situation. It seems that during an interview between PRIETO (probably Jose PRIETO Renitez, Director of Foreign Relations of the DAP) and the Minister of Public Works, PRIETO was asked to provide a list of scholarship candidates to be considered and he had none. Sonia mentioned that in Belgium they also lost four scholarships because of this same reason.

6. According to QUTIMID Sonia GOMEZ Aragon is married to one Miguel (LNU) and has a daughter named Iliaus. Sonia's mother is still living although appeared to be very ill at the time Sonia left for her trip to Madrid because Sonia cabled at least twice to Havana inquiring about the status of her mother's health. (TYLOTE reported that Sonia's home phone number in Havana is 7-4263.) Perhaps Headquarters can determine the full name of her husband by checking the reverse telephone listings Sonia is attractive, intelligent, serious-minded and reserved. The last time she visited Spain she stayed with Vera BORODOWSKI and was on the same type of mission as the present one - to discuss the Madrid Embassy's work plan. She also visited the Barcelona Consulate and the Cuban Embassy in Lisbon.

30 April 1970

NAME: Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez (201-735296)
(NOTE: A comprehensive study/analysis on RUIZ was prepared in February 1970, see OSMW-11726.)
ALIAS: Also uses Guillermo RUIZ Perez
DPOB: 16 February 1930, Havana
PRESENT POSITION: Minister, Charge d'Affaires, Cuban Embassy, Madrid, since December 1967.
WIFE: Nilda VECIANA Lopez (DPOB: 26 December 1934, Havana)
CHILDREN: Five sons, and a sixth child due to be born April/May 1970, Guillermo, the oldest, in school in Cuba. Alejandro, Julio, Juan Carlos and Ivan with their parents in Madrid.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: White, variously described as 5'5" - 5'7" tall, and 170-190 pounds, stout build; round face, fair complexion, blond slightly wavy hair, light-colored eyes (also reported as blue and green), wears glasses. No visible identifying marks. Well dressed.
PERSONALITY: Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ sums up his personality - "a man of many moods." He has variously been described as intelligent, mentally alert, competent, hardworking, and respected by his subordinates. Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered, brusque but sincere, opinionated, strong-minded idealistic, self-confident. Has basic emotional instability, gives impression of being insecure in his position. At times sarcastic, indifferent, egotistical, cynical, serious, ungrateful and cold, who, paradoxically, appears friendly to some people. Outspoken, compulsive talker, articulate, limited vocabulary, swears a good deal.

---

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez

EDUCATION: He can turn on considerable charm, where motivated. In contrast to his pleasant public image and acceptable language, private conversation is vulgar, swears continually and flies into rages.

Likes good living and spends money where it shows. Avid reader, keeps abreast of world events, shows willingness to accept whatever he deems to be good or useful from the outside world. Concerned with the image and prestige of Cuba in Spain. Emotionally committed to an ideal. An AMEDIT study summed RUIZ up as a realist. He speaks English and French. His wife, a teacher, always worked before going to Spain, and there works as a secretary and bookkeeper at the Embassy on an informal basis. Appears intelligent, competent, outspoken but solicitous and affectionate with her husband; interested in, and encourages him in his work. Appears to support the regime, but not a fanatic. RUIZ is the dominant personality of the two.

One reference states that he went to work at age 14, which suggests lack of formal education.
