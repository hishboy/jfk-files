(described as a Cuban exile residing in Venezuela and a member of the Central Directorate of Police in Venezuela. [POSADA] is possibly CIA source in Caracas as his characterization by the DIA source and CIA are similar and information reported by DIA and CIA are similar.) DIA information report indicates that Cuban exile group known as the Ejercito De Liberacion Cubano (ELC) (Cuban Army of Liberation) plans to use Mona Island, off the coast of Puerto Rico, as a storage place and possibly as a training base. According to the source, this group has received assistance from the Government of Venezuela in the form of weapons, amount and type not disclosed, and an "old" boat about 60 to 80' long. [POSADA] reported to the [Cuban exile] source that the ELC has made at least one trip to Mona Island [from Venezuela] for the purpose of carrying supplies.

It should be noted that the boat described by [POSADA] is possibly identical with the launch Maria Constanza described in CIA Information Cable as vessel being used to ship arms [from Venezuela].

A copy of the DIA Information Report was furnished locally to the San Juan Office by Detachment 2, USAFSD, San Juan. DIA Information Report indicates that dissemination was made to CAS, Miami, Florida.
