Reference is made to my memorandum of September 23, 1975, which advised you of a request I received concerning legal representation for W. Donald Stewart a former Special Agent of this Bureau who has been requested to submit to interview by the Senate Select Committee.

Mr. Stewart telephonically advised on September 24, 1975, that he had been contacted by James Dick of the Senate Select Committee and again asked to appear for interview concerning mail openings. Mr. Stewart explained to Mr. Dick that he was arranging with the Department of Justice for legal representation and until these arrangements were completed, he did not feel it was appropriate for him to be interviewed. According to Mr. Stewart, Mr. Dick informed him that the Committee could not wait for such arrangements to be completed and that arrangements should be made at this time for the interview. Mr. Dick implied that, if he did not agree to an interview in the immediate future, a subpoena would be issued. As a result, Mr. Stewart agreed to appear September 26, 1975, for interview by the Senate Select Committee concerning mail openings. He, however, did not indicate whether he intends to furnish information at that time.

Mr. Stewart inquired as to the status of the request for legal representation which he requested by memorandum. He was advised that this matter had not as yet been resolved and that he would be expeditiously advised of the resolution of his request.

In view of the immediate problem concerning legal representation for Mr. Stewart, it is respectfully requested that this Bureau be expeditiously advised of your decision in this matter.

Reference is made to the memorandum dated August 13, 1975,
from Mr. Douglas R. Marvin, Counselor to the Attorney General, to
Mr. W. Raymond Wannall, of this Bureau, captioned, "Senate Select
Committee Request for Information on Warrantless Electronic
Surveillances," which enclosed an SSC request dated July 7, 1975, and
to my memoranda, captioned as above, dated August 25, 1975,
September 16, 1975, and September 19, 1975.
Enclosed is the original of a memorandum containing
responses to questions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as they pertain to FBI war-
rantless microphone and telephone surveillances. My memorandum
to you dated September 16, 1975, indicated these responses were being
prepared separately.
In conformity with our prior responses to these SSC requests,
the identity of the requesting Presidential appointee is omitted. This
criteria did not become applicable until the recent Presidential
Directive which is the subject of the SSC request question #23b, the
response to which the Department has reserved for itself. Our response
therefore states all electronic surveillance requests are signed by the
Director or Acting Director of the FBI.

The Attorney General

A briefing for Senators Church and Tower has been provided
covering warrantless electronic surveillances, surreptitious entry for
recovery of cryptographic material, teletype coverage requested by the
National Security Agency and electronic penetration of communications
equipment requested by the National Security Agency. The White House
asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to any
requests from the SSC covering these matters until the briefing had been
given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters
to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information
throughout the SSC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the
enclosed material not be made available to the SSC staff until it is dis-
cussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the
White House that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that
access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,
and SSC Staff Director William Miller only.

A copy of the memorandum is enclosed for your records.

NOTE:

Memorandum 8/25/75 to the Attorney General, enclosed
responses to questions 2, 3, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 21. Memorandum 9/19/75
to the Attorney General enclosed the response to question 24. Memorandum
9/16/75 to the Attorney General enclosed responses to questions 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 11, 12, and 17. The latter memorandum excluded FBI warrantless
electronic surveillance statistics relative to questions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
since this data required more time for compilation. This data has now
been compiled and is contained in the memorandum enclosed with this
letter. Responses have now been provided to all questions in the SSC
request dated 7/7/75 which were assigned to the Bureau by the Attorney
General's office.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO WARRANTLESS
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES FOR
NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSES

Reference is made to SSC letter dated July 7, 1975, with
attached questionnaire. By memorandum dated September 16, 1975,
replies were given to questions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they pertained to
agencies other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This
response pertains to FBI requests for both telephone and microphone
warrantless electronic surveillances utilized in FBI investigations.
The response excludes from consideration the electronic surveillances
utilized regarding the "Kissinger 17," Joseph Kraft, and Yeoman
Charles Edward Radford. These matters have been the subject of
individual SSC inquiries. The material furnished to the Committee
or to which it has been given access in regard to these specific mat-
ters provides the data which would respond to questions 4, 5, 6, 7,
and 8.
