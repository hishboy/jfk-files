NARRATIVE COMMENTS

SECTION C

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to

overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment

on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best

basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness

in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete

Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper. During most of the period reported on, Subject

was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phase-

out of the Station. Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject

continued to maintain a satisfactory degree of morale in agents assigned

him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and con-

tinued to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of

a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally

by Subject on illegal activities of Cuban refugees was of great interest

to other agencies offices in the area. Subject was the only Station

source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's

ability to maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period

because of the cutback in infiltration operations.

It could also be noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this

Station and prepares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly

professional intelligence officer and is, in many ways, an outstanding

one. Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though

his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as

well. Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport

with foreign agents. He has an imaginative approach to operations,

is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his

assignments. He is a definite asset to WOFIRM.

SECTION C

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to

overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment

on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best

basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness

in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete

Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper. During the period under review, Subject has

continued to produce at his previous high level and he has planned and

executed three intelligence collection operations against a denied area

with the two teams under his supervision and direction. His leadership

qualities have, to a large degree, enabled him to maintain his commando

group morale at a high level under the difficult circumstances of en-

forced inactivity. Subject's indigenous agents respect him and are

willing to follow his instructions to the letter. Subject's seemingly

limitless resourcefulness, drive and initiative coupled with his

demonstrated proficiency for this type of work mark him as one of the

few persons known to the Rater who is ideally suited to this particular

type of agent handling on a day-to-day, face-to-face basis.

During the reporting period Subject has committed his four infil-

tration boat teams on a total of seven operations and excellent results

have been realized. He has conducted extensive testing of equipment

and techniques in support of Station requirements and Headquarters

requests. His reporting after these field tests has shown that his

reporting ability has improved to such a degree to warrant a rating of

strong in this duty.

He is cost and security conscious and has demonstrated his effective-

ness in the use of personnel, equipment and operational funds. Subject

has not had the benefit of formal language training and does not have a

definitive language capability. In view of his long tenure of field assign-

ments during has career with WOFACT, it is recommended he be given

During this period he has shown an outstanding proficiency in the

supervision of his Commando Group. He is responsible for the

logistical support, maintenance, planning and operations of the

group and must also maintain their motivation and moral. As a result

of the stand-down in PM activities at this Station, one of his major

duties has been keeping his group motivated and happy. Subject has

performed these tasks in a very professional manner; he has shown

strong leadership qualities and a definite ability to adapt to

difficult and frustrating changes in the operational climate.

Subject has had the additional duty of handling an FI Agent for

the Station. He has spent long hours on this activity and has shown

that he is fully capable of broadening his xope of activities to

other fields besides the supervision of a commando group. He is

cost and security conscious and has shown that he is effective in

the use of personnel, space, equipment and operational funds.
