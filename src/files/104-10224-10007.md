MEMORANDUM FOR MR. N. SCOTT MILER

VIA: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT: Expression of Appreciation (U)

1. I hereby express my appreciation for service of the highest degree of excellence provided to my office during the past several months. You displayed professional competence that can only be described as exemplary in nature.

2. It is unfortunate that the work on which you performed is of such a nature that it precludes a specific description herein, but that need not detract from the significance of this message of approbation. Of all the attributes displayed, the two most worthy of note are your use of imagination and persistence. These two qualities enabled you to produce results which others had not been able to obtain. Near failure was transformed into success.

3. Not to be ignored is your administrative ability. The marshaling of resources available to you and coordination of the efforts of your available personnel contributed materially to the degree and quality of results obtained as well as the expeditious manner in which you proceeded. Also, selflessness was manifested by your willingness to ignore assigned working hours and press on as long as any hope existed for obtaining results.

4. As you are aware, the results achieved by you have significance beyond the boundaries of the Navy. The full import cannot be completely evaluated at this time but it is known that the lives of many persons will be enriched by your efforts. It is regretted that all persons affected will not have the opportunity to express their thanks to you in person for the part you have played.

5. On behalf of all persons who will benefit from your efforts, and on behalf of the Navy and myself, I again express my deepest appreciation and say to you a most hearty "Well done".

6. If it is consistent with the policy of your Agency, it is requested that a copy of this letter be made a part of your official record.

Letter of Appreciation

1. On 25 February 1965, Mr. N. Scott Miler of your Staff presented an excellent lecture to participants in Security Officers Field Course #15 on "Security Support to CI Activities." Mr. Miler made the talk very interesting and stimulating, and, judging from the class comments, it was very well received.

2. I should like to take this opportunity to advise both you and Mr. Miler that his cooperation and efforts on behalf of the Office of Security are very much appreciated.

1 February 1962

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion - Newton Scott Miler

1. It is recommended that Newton Scott Miler be promoted

from his present grade of GS-14 to GS-15. Miler was assigned

to the Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present

position of Chief of Station, Addis Ababa, in September 1961.

He has been in grade since 24 March 1957. In accepting his

present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very com-

plicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation

and modification. In a short time he has been able to give

purpose and direction to operations which previously had been

the subject of considerable controversy within DD/P. It is

worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost

entirely new team, few of whom had any previous experience in

African operations.

2. Under normal circumstances, the Supervisor would be

inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further

opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the

individual. It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception

to this rule. Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,

Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor

who is presently Deputy Chief, CI-CE Staff. This man had

apparently felt so strongly about Miler's performance that he

had suggested that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who

should be given a jump promotion to supergrade. If necessary a

memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

3. In addition to the above, the Supervisor has been

associated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1946.

The only gap in continuity was from the period 1956 to 1959. It

is felt, therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's

knowledge, ability, experience, and potential bears weight.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, CI Staff

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of

Newton Scott Miler

1. It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.

2. During the two years that he has been an officer of the

Operations Group of the CI Staff Mr. Miler has demonstrated an

exceptional ability to interpret counterintelligence experience and

practice in guiding operations in this area throughout the divisions

of the DD/P. He has applied field experience gained in one area,

combined with expertly informed Headquarters knowledge, to

intricate and sensitive problems affecting U. S. security in a

variety of geographic areas from the Far East to the Western

Hemisphere and Europe with outstanding skill and sureness of

judgment. He is aggressive, devotes long hours uncomplainingly

to his tasks, and willingly contributes his guidance to officers of

less experience. In personal relationships throughout the

Clandestine Services he is admired, respected, and well-liked.

His recommendations are eagerly sought and contribute in major

fashion to increased effectiveness in carrying out the Cl mission.

It is again strongly recommended that he be promoted to GS-15.

1. It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.

2. Since July 1955 Mr. Miler has been serving in the Soviet/

Satellite Branch of the CI Staff, Operations Division. In this

position he has made a major contribution to the CI mission in his

daily contacts with elements of the DD/P, Office of Training and

Office of Security. Mr. Miler has excellent motivation, works long

hours, readily accepts responsibility, and is highly effective in

expressing his views both orally and in written form. He is

resourceful, imaginative, and his operational judgment is superior.

The frequency with which his professional advice is sought on an

informal and personal basis is clear evidence of the high regard

with which he is held by many individuals in the Clandestine

Services. I strongly recommend him for Promotion to the next

higher grade.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OPERATIONS MISSION TO THAILAND

BANGKOK, THAILAND

April 9, 1958

Mr. Theo E. Hall

Chief, Public Safety Division

International Cooperation Administration

Washington 25, D. C.

Re: Newton S. Miler

Dear Theo:

You have by now received our unclassified cable, TOICA 1408,

advising of our acceptance of the resignation of Newton S. Miler who

has served since December 29, 1956, as Chief of our Criminal

Investigation Branch, Public Safety Division, USOM/T. It was with

deep regret that I accepted the resignation since his departure on or

about April 15, 1958, will be felt very keenly by both the Chief of

the Division, Mr. Al Dubois, and myself.

Were it not for the pressing need of stateside medical

attention for his wife and the fact that he should be with her

during this period, I should have endeavored to prevail on him to

take an alternative course of action. However, I am satisfied that

there was no alternative and, hence, did accept the resignation

effective April 15, 1958, it being noted that he is returning with

his family to the States at his own expense.

This letter is to advise you of the facts leading to what

would appear to be a sudden resignation. I also want to inform you

that Miler's job performance here has, in my estimation, been of high

order and can very easily be summarized by stating that he has

performed most satisfactorily.

He has shown himself consistently to be tactful, considerate,

and objective in his approach to his responsibilities and in the

performance of his duties. I have at all times found that his judgment

has been sound and mature. He has had warm and mutually satisfying

relationship with his opposite numbers in the Thai police.

In furtherance of my statement of my confidence in him, I

unhesitatingly designated him as Acting Chief of our Public Safety

Division during Mr. Dubois' absence on TDY in Washington for the period

March 9 through April 5, 1958. I naturally had continuing personal

---

14-00000

Mr. Theo. E. Hall April 9, 1958

contact with him during that period and observed his handling of

himself in Executive Staff meetings. The various attributes which I

cited above were clearly demonstrated during this period and, in fact,

his performance during this period permits me to add that I am

satisfied with his supervisory abilities.

I would have no hesitancy in recommending his reemployment

by ICA if in the future the present family health situation is

rectified.

Sincerely,

Thomas E. Naughten
