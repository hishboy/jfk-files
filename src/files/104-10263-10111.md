FROM: Paul

I'm not overly enthusiastic about the possibilities of getting much from SKEWER/1; however, I would like to meet him and chat about his friends and business associates in the W/L Islands. He possibly might be used as an entree to reporting or support assets.

It would be my opinion that we would not have to bring his clearance up to date to chat with him.

Paul

I've not made any notes from the files; therefore, if Ed agrees to helping us, details should be forwarded to me prior to my departure for San Juan.

Skewer/1 201
26 January 1965

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Antilles Material Company Limited (AMCO)
Meeting with SKEWER/1 on the Relationship of the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO

1. As agreed in his 11 January 1965 meeting with SKEWER/1, Mr. Edward Stanulis telephoned SKEWER/I on the morning of 18 January to arrange a meeting with SKEWER/1 at his convenience later in the day. SKEWER/1 suggested a meeting at 1500 hours that afternoon in his office at the Puerto Rican Iron Works in Ponce. He indicated to Mr. Stanulis that the Puerto Rican Cement Company looks with favor on AMCO and is doing business with it through its Manager, Mr. Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr.

2. Prior to the meeting, Messrs. Allen, Carter, and Stanulis reviewed the approach to be made to SKEWER/1 in the light of his favorable view of AMCO. It was agreed that no mention would be made of the fact that AMCO is in poor financial condition or that Mr. Philpotts is inadequate as a manager. Stress would be laid upon assessment of the long-term commercial viability of AMCO because KUBARK is ostensibly interested in placing an officer in a managerial position in AMCO, or some other similar firm, in order to monitor Castro's activities in the Caribbean area.

3. Messrs. Allen, Carter, and Stanulis arrived precisely at 1500 hours at SKEWER/'s office on the second floor of the Puerto Rican Iron Works. His male secretary asked us to take seats in the corridor outside his office. Within a few minutes his “secretary reappeared and asked us to wait in the Conference Room. Some ten minutes later SKEWER/1 appeared and invited us into his private office. He was extremely cordial and gracious. Mr. Stanulis introduced Mr. Allen as a colleague who is assessing AMCO's commercial viability. He introduced Mr. Carter as a lawyer consultant who is obtaining background information in the event KUBARK should decide to proceed with placement of an officer in AMCO.

14-00000

4. Mr. Allen informed SKEWER/1 that KUBARK is assessing the factors bearing on the long-term commercial viability of AMCO. He explained that such an assessment is necessary because KUBARK does not want to place an officer in a company which is not commercially viable for the long term. One of the factors bearing on the commercial viability of AMCO is the relationship of the Puerto Rican Cement Company with AMCO and the terms of any agreements. We would also like his views on commodities other than cement which can be shipped from Puerto Rico to the suber islands and what commodities can be shipped on return voyages. Another factor of interest is competition in the shipping field.

5. SKEWER/1 indicated that he needed some clarification of KUBARK objectives. Mr. Stanulis reviewed KUBARK ostensible interest in having an experienced commercial man in a commercially viable shipping company for the purpose of checking on Castro activities in the Caribbean area. SKEWER/1 assumed that Mr. Philpotts was the man in whom we are interested. Mr. Allen dispelled this assumption explaining that KUBARK has a candidate whom we would like to place in a managerial position in AMCO if it is determined that AMCO is commercially viable. KUBARK would seek to effect this placement through a friend on the Board who, like SKEWER/1, has helped KUBARK in the past and would undoubtedly help again. SKEWER/1 said, "Oh, yes, through the top man in the company." He then asked if Mr. Philpotts would know of KUBARK interest. Mr. Allen replied no, emphasizing that our interest should be closely held.

6. SKEWER/1 said that he had not realized that we wanted so much detail and asked if we desired to talk with the man in his company most familiar with AMCO. Mr. Stanulis declined, emphasizing that we wanted to keep our interest in this matter confined solely to SKEWER/1. SKEWER/1 immediately agreed to make the necessary telephone calls to obtain answers to our questions. As the basis for his inquiry, he would ask about the amount of credit extended by the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO. SKEWER/1 then made a series of telephone calls to one of his subordinates named Tomas and also made one call to his son. The following information was obtained in the above telephone calls:

a. AMCO has 2 or 3 ships under charter and ships primarily cement to Martinique, Guadeloupe, Barbados, and Antigua.

SECRET

---

14-00000

b. The Puerto Rican Cement Company has a verbal agreement with Mr. Philpotts granting him exclusive distribution of cement in Guadeloupe, Barbados, and Antigua.

c. AMCO currently owes the Puerto Rican Cement Company $40,000 and is slow in payment.

d. The normal procedure for payment is for the consignee to pay Mr. Philpotts by a note which the Puerto Rican Cement Company discounts.

e. The Puerto Rican Cement Company is currently examining how much credit it can extend to AMCO. In this connection the company is examining whether credit extended to AMCO can be insured under the Foreign Credit Insurance Association. (FCIA insures 80% of export credit.) If so, the risk to the Puerto Rican Cement Company would be reduced and further credit could be extended.

f. The Puerto Rican Cement Company has sold 133,000 bags of cement to AMCO.

7. SKEWER/1 said that Mr. Philpotts is aggressive and that he is pushing Puerto Rican cement. Mr. Carter asked SKEWER/1 if his firm were worried about the amount of credit extended to AMCO. SKEWER/1 replied that AMCO is trying to help the Puerto Rican Cement Company and Puerto Rican Cement is in turn trying to help AMCO. SKEWER/1 imparted the impression that he has absolute confidence in his subordinates. In calling Tomas, SKEWER/1 said to us that he had gone over the head of his son. SKEWER/1 was not aware that AMCO Puerto Rico is a subsidiary of AMCO Panama. When apprised of this fact, he said that this arrangement is probably for tax purposes. SKEWER/1 left the impression that he considers AMCO as a Puerto Rican company and one worthy of support. He recalled that he had previously given a job to a Trujillo opponent, Fred Imbert, whom no one else would hire. Mr. Imbert now has his own shipping company and SKEWER/1 suggested that we assess his operation. He recalled that Mr. Trujillo had telephoned him about harboring a criminal. SKEWER/1 told Trujillo to mind his own business as would SKEWER/1. Mr. Stanulis indicated that KUBARK would not want to consider Fred Imbert's operation, given his family's involvement in the Dominican Republic. Throughout the conversation, the picture emerged of a man who trusts his subordinates and who would help an individual or firm, particularly Puerto Rican, which is also trying to help his firm.

SECRET

8. Mr. Allen said that we would assess the situation carefully, and in the event it should be determined to proceed, we would advise him. Mr. Allen informed him that two New York firms have invested in AMCO, namely, W.R. Grace and Company, and Train, Cabot and Associates. Our friend is Mr. Train, who, as he surmised, is the top man in his firm. Mr. Allen revealed this information to SKEWER/1 in the event that it should be deemed desirable for Mr. Train to negotiate with the Puerto Rican Cement Company. Conversely, in the event of AMCO's failure, it was felt that SKEWER/1 should know that KUBARK is not connected with any other participants. SKEWER/1 offered full cooperation. He had arranged his schedule to give us as much time as necessary. In our presence he received a telephone call in which he apologized for cancelling an appointment in order to accommodate us. It is considered that, as in his past relations with KUBARK, SKEWER/1 can be trusted and will help KUBARK in any way he can.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record
SUBJECT: Project WUBRINY--Antilles Materials Company, Ltd., Discussion by Mr. Edward Stanulis with SKEWER/1.

1. I made initial telephonic contact with SKEWER/1 at approximately 1100 hours on 10 January 1965 and made arrangements for a meeting in my hotel room for the following day between the hours of 1600 and 1700 to be followed by another on Tuesday at a time and place that would be convenient for SKEWER/1. Later in the day SKEWER/1 informed me that he would be unable to meet with us on Tuesday as he was leaving by air on the evening of 11 January for a series of appointments in the States.

2. The meeting with SKEWER/1 was held in my hotel room at 1645 hours on 11 January. I told SKEWER/1 that as he knew, one of KUBARK's prime information targets in Latin America concerned the activities of Castro's Cuba and that in this connection some of our people had been thinking for some time that it would be most useful in pursuing this requirement to have entree into shipping interests that were active in Caribbean waters. SKEWER/I said he thought this idea excellent. I further stated that these people had heard that SKEWER/1's firm was discussing the possibility of entering into an exclusive Caribbean distributorship contract with Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr., who is associated with the Antilles Materials Company, Ltd. S.A. of Panama and Puerto Rico, and asked him if he had any knowledge of the individual or the negotiations. SKEWER/1 replied that he did not know of either, but that his son would be familiar with both.

3. I asked SKEWER/1 if he would be willing to investigate the situation discreetly without mentioning any interest on KUBARK's part and at the same time consider the commercial feasibility of the venture for AMCO. He agreed.

4. In elaborating on the basic concept, I told SKEWER/1 that if the proper maritime firm were located (that is, one that may be floundering now but has commercial viability potential), we would be interested in placing with the company an individual who possesses the necessary commercial background qualifications and also has the capability of accomplishing certain KUBARK requirements, SKEWER/1 reiterated his conviction that the concept is an excellent one and said he would do all in his power to

help KUBARK achieve this objective.

5. I told him that I would appreciate his cooperation in meeting with two of my friends who are more fully versed in these matters. He agreed and set the meeting for Monday, 19 January 1965. SKEWER/1 gave me his unlisted private telephone number and suggested that I contact him Monday morning, 19 January 1965, to set time and place for the meeting. The number is 842-2120.

Case Officer Comment:

The meeting with SKEWER/1 confirmed Mr. Philpotts' report that his relations with the Puerto Rican Cement Company are good. It also revealed the terms of the relationship between the Puerto Rican Cement Company and AMCO which Mr. Philpotts had not reported in detail to WUBRINY/2. It is obvious that Mr. Philpotts has sold himself to certain officials in the Puerto Rican Cement Company who have the confidence of the Company's top management. The extent to which Mr. Philpotts may have conned other businessmen into extending credit and the amount of such credit is a key factor for investigation by WUBRINY/1 and /2, and Mr. Malia on their forthcoming trip. It is feared that Mr. Philpotts has incurred so many debts that the firing of Mr. Philpotts and reorganization of AMCO would be prohibitively expensive.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Antilles Materials Company, Ltd.
14 January 1965

1. Mr. Ed Stanulis telephoned Mr. Allen at home from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 11 January 1965. He met with SKEWER/1 as scheduled at 3 P.M. SKEWER/1 was not familiar with any negotiations between the Puerto Rican Cement Company and AMCO but agreed to look quietly into the matter. He made a telephone call to PR Cement's Sales Manager before he left for New York. SKEWER/1 said that he had such a heavy schedule on this trip, requiring his presence in New York, Chicago, and Connecticut, that he could not squeeze in a meeting with KUBARK representatives. He would, however, be glad to meet with KUBARK representatives in Puerto Rico on 18 January 1965. This delay would also enable him to investigate thoroughly the status of negotiations with AMCO.

2. Mr. Stanulis said that he had followed the previously agreed approach to SKEWER/1. He emphasized that KUBARK is interested in AMCO only to the extent that a feasible commercial arrangement can be worked out so that placement of an officer in AMCO to work against Cuba would make sense. He indicated that AMCO is not doing too well financially and that the question is whether it can be resurrected on a sound commercial basis. Mr. Stanulis informed SKEWER/1 that KUBARK is not interested in taking an equity position in AMCO.

3. Mr. Stanulis affirmed unequivocally to Mr. Allen his previous assessment of SKEWER/1, namely that SKEWER/1 will do anything to help KUBARK, particularly against Cuba. Mr. Stanulis will write a report upon arrival in Washington on or about 13 January 1965.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Antilles Materials Company, Ltd.

1. Messrs. Allen and Carter met on 8 January 1965 with Mr. Edward Stanulis, former COS San Juan, to discuss an approach to SKEWER/1 for information on subject company. It was agreed that Mr. Stanulis would go to Puerto Rico on 9 January and contact SKEWER/1 on the 10th. Hopefully SKEWER/1 could obtain information on negotiations between Puerto Rican Cement Company and AMCO in time for a meeting with Messrs Stanulis, Allen, and Carter on 12 January. Messrs. Allen and Carter would plan to arrive in San Juan at 10:50 P.M. on 11 January.

2. Mr. Stanulis would apprise SKEWER/1 of KUBARK's interest in placing a KUBARK officer in a small shipping and trading company operating in the Caribbean area in order to monitor Cuban activities. SKEWER/1 would be cautioned to keep this knowledge confidential. In this connection, Mr. Stanulis said that SKEWER/1 had proved to be absolutely reliable from the security point of view. Mr. Stanulis would advise SKEWER/1 that KUBARK is looking at AMCO which is negotiating with the Puerto Rican Cement Company to be its cement distributor in the Caribbean area. SKEWER/1 would be asked to confirm any negotiations and the terms involved. His answers would be given in the subsequent meeting with Messrs. Stanulis, Allen, and Carter. Further discussion with SKEWER/1 would be conditioned on his answers. In any case KUBARK representatives would ascertain his views on the validity of AMCO's commercial concept and on any possibility for commercial collaboration between PR Cement and AMCO.

3. Mr. Stanulis on 10 January 1965 telephoned Mr. Allen at home to report that he has a meeting scheduled with SKEWER/1 at 3 P.M. on 11 January. SKEWER/1 is leaving the night of 11 January for New York where he will remain through part of 15 January. Mr. Stanulis will try to get a flight out of Puerto Rico for New York, so that a meeting may be arranged for Messrs. Stanulis, Allen, and Carter with SKEWER/1 in New York. Mr. Stanulis will call Mr. Allen after his meeting with SKEWER/1. Mr. Stanulis is staying at the Hotel Da Vinci, Room 81.
