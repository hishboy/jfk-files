RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

RESUME

Giulia Pat Mainieri Barrow
509 Kentucky Avenue, S. E.
Washington, D. C.
202-546-4912

CAPITOL HILL EXPERIENCE:

January - July, 1971--Glenn M. Anderson of California
Joined staff as secretary to the administrative assistant, Harry Anderson. Stayed here only six months because I did not find the work challenging and was losing my skills because I was not using them enough. Salary was approximately $6,800 to $7,400.

September, 1971 - September, 1975--Office of the Legislative Counsel
Was member of the secretarial pool taking a great deal of shorthand and typing from 25-30 attorneys. This job was extremely demanding but was also excellent experience. I left a bit reluctantly to go to school.

December, 1975 - November, 1976--Richard F. Vander Veen of Michigan
Became member of this staff on a part-time basis. My duties involved typing letters composed by entire staff except administrative assistant. Here again, as in the Counsel, I had responsibility for a great deal of typing, but less shorthand than before. I learned how to work two kinds of automatic typewriters and was responsible for using them for large-volume mailings. Left staff after this seat turned over after election. Salary approximately $6,500 for a twenty hour week.

PRIOR TO HILL EXPERIENCE:

March, 1970 - January, 1971--Shering Pharmaceutical Company
Secretary for two product managers, John Moser and Toby Madison. Had many different responsibilities: filing, typing, shorthand, telephone calling and answering, making reservations for overseas trips and in-country trips, and greeting business clients. Enjoyed this job greatly. Salary approximately $6,400.

Personal Information: Date of birth--October 26, 1950--Houston, Texas
Marital Status--Married, no children
Health--Excellent
