MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Edward G. TICHBORN - Cover Company Listing of Operational/Travel Costs

1. On 22 June 1967, WH/6 received an informal listing from TICHBORN (first requested in April 1966) which was made by the ICAP accountant (unwitting) of TICHBORN's expenses for travel and entertainment during the period 1 October 1966 - 31 March 1967. These expenses were incurred by TICHBORN in (1) developing his cover by cover company-directed travel; (2) actual Agency-directed travel and entertainment; and (3) travel and expenses for the primary benefit of the cover company.

21 June 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, DO

SUBJECT: Operational Survey in Spain by Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1. After considerable coordination, agreement was finally secured from EUR Division and COS/Madrid for Edward G. Tichborn (P) to undertake an operational survey in Spain. Chief and Deputy Chief EUR/IB plus the undersigned had a preliminary meeting with Tichborn on 20 June 1967. Background reading was provided him preparatory to a detailed briefing. The latter was effected by DC/IB and the undersigned on 21 June 1967.

2. Tichborn's mission is to identify operational targets, primarily in the business community but not excluding those in the military establishment, the Government, and the church, including Opus Dei. Identification is desired of elements, particularly in the business community, which have political influence now and which could be more important after Franco's death. After identifying such elements, Tichborn is to seek ways and means of access to them. He will, of course, pay particular attention to the local Spanish partners of ICAP Iberia in terms of their political activities and their contacts with key officials. He will assess ICAP Iberia as a cover mechanism, and in the event of a favorable assessment, explain in detail how it could be exploited. He will assess one of ICAP Iberia's local partners whose aunt was a famous RIS agent.

3. Tichborn is leaving New York on 24 June 1967 and will arrive in Madrid on the morning of 25 June 1967. He has been given the telephone number and address of DCCS/Madrid, Mr. Osborne Day, who will be his contact. Tichborn, upon arrival, will telephone Mr. Day. The latter has been alerted by WOFACT cable of Tichborn's arrival. WUBRINY/1 will meet Tichborn in Madrid on 28 June and make appropriate introductions.

4. It is anticipated that Tichborn will spend about a month in Madrid or as long as it is commercially plausible and operationally necessary to fulfill his mission. Necessary commercial groundwork

--- Page 14 ---

14-00000

has been laid. Tichborn recently met one of the Spanish partners in New York who was on a short visit to the U. S. They agreed that when Tichborn visited Spain, they would jointly work on a prospectus that could be used to increase business for ICAP Iberia.

5. It is estimated that Tichborn's trip will cost about $2,500.00. Approval is requested to obligate $2,500.00 of FY 67 D&TO funds for this purpose.

REQUEST FOR FY 1968 PROJECT EXTENSION AND TERMINATION

PROJECT NAME UOACE

Total Funds Requested: $5,500

Amount in which Project was included in the Operational Program for FY 1968: $20,250

3. Current Objectives: To support Contract Agent Edward G. TICHBORN (P) who is used as a covert action advisor and political action agent by WHD. In addition TICHBORN is available for election campaign research, special political surveys on selected countries and other research requirements which can utilize his political expertise and area knowledge.

4. Background: In 1959 TICHBORN, a bilingual Harvard-trained lawyer with political experience, was hired as a political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election operations throughout Latin America. He has participated in political operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina and the Dominican Republic. While based in Mexico City from 1961 until 1966, he was primarily a Headquarters asset but also assisted the Mexico City Station in its CA program. In August 1966 he was assigned PCS to New York City where he has been employed for cover purposes since October 1966 by the DO proprietary WUSALINE.

5. Effectiveness: During the period 1 October 1966 - 30 June 1967, WH/6 has had an opportunity to use TICHBORN in his primary role of political action advisor on only one occasion. In February TICHBORN was sent to Puerto Rico to conduct a political action briefing of a Station Santo Domingo asset, AMANTHEM-4, which task he performed effectively. In order to maximize the benefits of his availability, he was assigned the continuing task of monitoring the Dominican Republic press and analyzing media reactions towards Balaguer and opposition elements. Several detailed summaries were submitted to the Dominican desk. A major effort was made to develop an in-depth study of the PRI party in Mexico. After a number of meetings with Headquarters and

--- Page 20 ---

14-00000

Mexico City Station officers and early enthusiasm on the part of TICHBORN's PRI contacts, those contacts became reluctant to delve into sensitive PRI areas or to introduce TICHBORN to other contacts with inside access. In May Headquarters, the Station, and TICHBORN all agreed that the effort should be dropped.

6. Cover and Security:

a. Cover: TICHBORN has done an excellent job of building his cover with WUSALINE. His area knowledge and language ability have proven of real help to the cover company, and he has shown himself unusually well suited to the needs of that company. The cover company demands on his time, both on-the-job and for foreign and domestic travel, have not interfered with his operational utilization.

b. Security: While in Mexico, TICHBORN acted as an unofficial legal advisor for the Center of Studies and Documentation which was mentioned in the MHDOWEL flap as being funded by a CA conduit. However, there was no publicity in Mexico which linked him with the Center. Similarly there was apparently no public exposure of the funding of the intellectual magazine with which he was connected, "Dialogos", by other CIA conduits. There is no available evidence that his security has been compromised by the MHDOWEL flap.

7. Termination and Extension:

While TICHBORN has been available for assignments calling for his abilities as a political action advisor, the Division has not had the requirements for such activities which were anticipated. The continuing use of TICHBORN for CIA tasks of lesser priority, together with the time and travel demands of his new cover business, have kept him well occupied during the period. However, in view of the future anticipated lack of demand for TICHBORN's services on a frequent basis, and the comparatively high cost in administrative, financial, and WH case officer time required, it is felt that the project should be terminated, effective 30 September 1967.

b. As indicated in the section above on "Cover and Security" TICHBORN has proven himself to be of real value to his cover company WUSALINE and to DO. Because of their interest in using

--- Page 21 ---

14-00000

-8-

him as a full-time asset, DO has agreed to assume full administrative and operational responsibility for TICHBORN, effective 1 July 1967. Responsibility for the fulfillment of TICHBORN's contract (effective through 30 September 1967) will be transferred to DO, effective 1 July 1967. Full financial responsibility for TICHBORN's salary and expenses will be transferred to DO on 1 October 1967. WHD and DO have agreed that because of TICHBORN's area knowledge and experience, WHD would enjoy a primacy of interest in his possible future operational use. WHD agreed to reimburse DO for the costs of salary and expenses for any such future use of TICHBORN.

8. In order to cover costs of salary and expense of TICHBORN until DO assumes financial responsibility on 1 October 1967, a FY 1968 extension of three months (from 1 July - 30 September 1967) is requested.

9. Coordination: Coordination outside the Agency is not necessary.

10. Costs: (1 July 1967 - 30 September 1967)

Salary (three months) $4,250

Travel 1,250

TOTAL $5,500

The Agent will be funded as follows:

a. WH Division will make funds available to DO to cover salary and travel expenses. DO will pass these funds to WUSALINE through existing funding channels.

b. The Agent will conform to Agency requirements in all his accountings.

11. Action Requested: Extension of Project UOACE for the period 1 July - 30 September 1967 in the amount of $5,500 and termination effective 30 September 1967.

SUBJECT Operational/MHSPAWN/TICHBORN Press Analysis

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

Reference: HDCW - 2588

Action: FYI

MICROFILMED

The Station appreciates the press analysis contained in the Reference, which was prepared by Edward G. TICHBORN. We feel that TICHBORN's comments on the press image of EMANTHEM/1 are particularly useful. As Headquarters is aware, however, EMANTHEM/1 has not shown himself particularly willing to take strides to improve his press image and continues to manifest a rather callous disregard for principles of public relations in general. While thus of no real immediate use, a continuing TICHBORN analysis would prove valuable should the opportunity present itself to render EMANTHEM/1 public relations advice and aid. We also believe such an analysis would be worthwhile in that it would keep TICHBORN himself up to date on the Dominican situation. Should it be decided to offer EMANTHEM/1 direct public relations or political advice, TICHBORN, in view of his established rapport with this individual, would be a natural candidate for the job. We would therefore appreciate further TICHBORN analysis, if practicable and convenient.

Chief, DO/CO

SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn (P)

25 May 1967

1. The undersigned on 23 May 1967 reviewed in WH Division Tichborn's 201 file (4 folders) and related operational files. Particular attention was given in this review to Tichborn's security.

2. The files reflect that Tichborn is very security conscious. There is no evidence that Tichborn was ever suspected of being a WOFACT operative.

3. Tichborn practiced law in California and was active in state and national politics. He was recruited as a political advisor on a part-time basis in 1959 by the CA Staff. In 1962, he was taken on full-time under contract by WH Division and assigned to Mexico City. His cover for this assignment was publishing and movie interests in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. In Mexico City he published a magazine, Dialogos aimed at left-wing intellectuals. The CI/OA staff review in 1965 stated that Tichborn's cover story was completely accepted by his friends and associates. The SGSWIRL of Tichborn in 1965 revealed that he had informed only his wife of his association with WOFACT.

4. The files reflect that Tichborn is very sensitive about security. He balked at working with a WOFACT officer in Mexico City, because a friend told Tichborn that the WOFACT officer not only was WOFACT but had openly admitted it to the friend. A proposed trip to Bolivia was aborted because Tichborn felt there was no suitable cover.

5. Tichborn has traveled extensively in Latin America on training and election assignments. Three countries in which he worked are Chile, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. On these assignments Tichborn used his legal, publishing, and movie cover. It is understood that he also used aliases and disguises, although this was not noted in the quick review of the files. He can, of course, be debriefed in detail on this aspect.

6. The files show that Tichborn's magazine, Dialogos was funded through Tichborn by various individuals through arrangements made by CCS. The C/WH/6 interrogated Tichborn on any foundation funding. Tichborn could recall only one instance of foundation funding, some $2-2,500 given Dialogos Editor Ramon Xirau by the Fairfield Foundation. There is also a reference in the files that one, Louis Mercier, was informed that ODACID also supported Dialogos.

7. The files reflect very favorably in Tichborn's performance - two reports by the Mexican Station and one from COS/Santo Domingo are most commendatory. On the negative side, administrative details bored him.

8. The undersigned has confirmed with Chief, WH/CA that if DO will take over Tichborn's contract, WH will pay Tichborn's salary and expenses for the first quarter of FY 1968. Chief, WH/CA is awaiting DO's decision.

9. The undersigned is very favorably impressed by Tichborn. By 1 October, it is believed that Tichborn will be sufficiently well-trained in commercial and investment banking matters to do legal-business consulting on a fee basis for WUSALINE. He should be able, depending on the number of operational requirements, to earn a part, if not all, of his salary. On this basis, it is recommended that DO assume administration of Tichborn effective 1 July 1966 with the understanding that WH Division will defray Tichborn's salary and expenses during the first quarter of FY 1968.

a. TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the reason for this is Menendez' sudden recognition of the danger to his political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become a controversial book. TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier in the negotiations. There was, however, no really clear explanation of why Menendez had so suddenly drawn into his shell.

b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt that in some ways we were not "taken" by Menendez. He responded with considerable heat by saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn
