MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: CIA Defector Watch List
For The Secret Service

1. On 13 June 1973 at 1100 hours a meeting attended by Mr. Jack Shaffer and Mr. Ernest Weidul, CDC; Mr. Jack Friedlander, SB; Mr. Negoy and Mr. Radulovich, DCS; Dr. Jerry Post, Psychiatric Staff and Mr. Tsikerdanos of the CI Staff was held at the CDC offices to discuss and decide which of those defectors for whom we have a legal responsibility should be watched during the BREZHNEV visit.

2. The Psychiatric Staff, SB and CDC had prepared lists of those defectors and others whom they felt were unpredictable, unstable and/or violent. The following are the names of those submitted (including comments made and the agreed on position the Agency would take):

A. Antanas SUTKUS (AEMIGALE) was the only defector listed by the KGB on their watch list. BUTKUS works for the RFE in Alexandria. He is noted as being non-violent and not likely to cause trouble. His wife who is studying to be a medical assistant is bitter towards the Soviets but also unlikely to cause trouble. He is a publicized defector. It was decided to pass his name routinely to the Secret Service.

B. ZAVOROSKIY (AEGOLD) who is in Seattle. He is the former sea captain who is a heavy drinker. He does not want to go to jail and therefore is likely to avoid trouble. It was decided to pass his name to the Secret Service.

C. SAKHAROV (AECLUSTER) a reformed drunk who is now reformed. He apparently was to begin school in Los Angeles on the 18th of June. He is passive. DCS will monitor him.

D. PETROV (AELENIS) Chicago. He also is a reformed drunk who is a straight A student. On the 16th of June (vacation) he will drive to Cape Cod to fish and relax. No problems.

E. CHALLY (Seattle) travels with an anti-Soviet crowd. He is unpredictable and has a bad temper. He shot a cab driver in Seattle last year. His name will be highlighted to the Secret Service.

F. TROFIMOV (AEFISSION) Bloomington, Indiana. He is also a drunk and a passer of bad checks. He is often in trouble. CI Staff apparently with the retirement of Jameson has no contact. When TROFIMOV is drunk he calls the Soviets at the UN Mission and talks of re-defection. He may possibly be in New York now living with two homosexual friends. Notify the Secret Service.

G. OGANESYAN (AEGAIN) Los Angeles. No passage. On 14 June 1973 Mr. Negoy notified me that AEGAIN was being checked by the police in Los Angeles. This may be in connection with something else.

H. GOLENIEWSKI (AEVISION). He is a real nut who aspires to the Romanoff crown. Notify the Secret Service.

I. NOSENKO (AEDONOR). No passage to the Secret Service. Note that DR Charles Bohrer, recommended that NOSENKO be added to the watch list for the Secret Service (memo attached).

J. GOLITZYN (AELADLE). Note that Mr. Osborne and Dr. Charles Bohrer both agreed that AELADLE be added to the watch list (memos attached). Both Mr. Friedlander and I sharply disagreed with this viewpoint. Mr. Shaffer requested that I check it out with Mr. Angleton. Mr. Angleton later emphatically concurred with withholding AELADLE's name from the list. I passed this to Mr. Shaffer later in the day.

K. BIMBLI (REPLEBE) an Albanian who lives in Chicago. He is very anti-CIA but not anti-Soviet. No passage.

L. VAGUINE (AECRUTCH) physicist, very stable who is doing well. No passage.

M. TEREKHOV (AESTUNT) space scientist in Texas. Very stable. He has rich relatives in Pittsburgh. No passage.

N. ROCHANSKI (BEGOOD) Polish who is in Texas. He was recruited in Oslo. He works in the Dallas Medical Center. He is vindictive and unpredictable. He has a son in Poland. BEGOOD recently wrote President Nixon about his son. He refuses to meet with CIA or the FBI. It was decided to add his name to the list for the Secret Service.

O. SEREGIN who CIA is in touch with came to the U.S. under the Refugee Act. CIA has no responsibility but we are in contact with him in New York. His wife is in Russia. His name will be passed.

P. MARININ also came into the U.S. under the Refugee Act. He has a wife in Bulgaria. CIA is in contact with him in Buffalo, New York. His name will be passed.

Q. TERESILOKOV who works for Radio Liberty. He is stable. No passage.

R. ANYZYUK - An oceanographer who came into the U.S. through the IRC. He works for the Logos Development Company. He is anti-Agency but very stable and sober. No passage.

Mr. Friedlander and I were in agreement on all the cases. He backed me up on AELADLE, AEDONOR and those other defectors in whom we had invested large sums of money, time and effort to conceal.

4. Copies of this memo (with attachments) will be placed in the 201 files of AELADLE, AEDONOR, AELENIS (no attachments), AECLUSTER, AEGAIN and AESTUNT.

Attachments: As stated

1. Dr. Charles Bohrer recommends (subject to Howard Osborne's concurrence) that the two following defectors be added to the Brezhnev visit watch list:

a. Anatoliy GOLITZYN (AELADLE). Delusions of grandeur; expected much more from the U.S. Government than he in fact received in terms of personal recognition. Frustrated, reclusive. May take some action to "get even."

b. Yuri NOSSENKO (AEDONOR). Not seriously neurotic, but because of the way in which he was handled he has reason to be vengeful, and may take the Brezhnev visit as an opportunity to embarrass us.

1. Howard Osborn's recommendations for the Brezhnev "watch list":

a. Delete NOSSENKO. He's happily rehabilitated, well disposed toward CIA and the USG, well adjusted. Not a threat.

b. GOLENIEWSKI. Absolutely nutty. Put him at the top of the list. He hates the Soviet Government because it's depriving him of the Romanov crown jewels.

c. Anatoliy GOLITZYN. Agree with Bohrer. Put him on the list.
