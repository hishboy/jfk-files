WUSHARP request for assistance

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information
Reference: DO BASE WASHINGTON 2989

1. On 14 December 1970, the undersigned visited WUSHARP at the latter's request and had the following discussion. WUSHARP asked whether we could use WUSLAB/1 as a means of contacting Cuban officials for the purpose of establishing ties which could later be exploited by WUSHARP assets. I explained to WUSHARP that WUSLAB/1 had been instructed to adopt a passive role in relationship to his Cuban contacts, and to respond only to contact initiated by the Cubans. WUSHARP stated that they understand our point of view thoroughly.

2. At this meeting I briefed WUSHARP on the telephone call from a DGI representative cited in reference. I told WUSHARP that I would give them a memorandum on this as well as a copy of the POQ on Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez (201-332665) in which they expressed definite interest.

27 APR 1970

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation
ATTENTION: Mr. D. J. Brennan
SUBJECT: Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, Cuban Intelligence Officer

Reference is made to your previous correspondence concerning Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, First Secretary of the Cuban Mission to the United Nations (CMUN) and an officer of the Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI). Rodriguez is the CUIS Case Officer for Jennifer Enid Miles, a South African national, now under investigation by the Bureau. Your most recent memorandum on Rodriguez and Miles was dated 26 January 1970.

On 30 January 1970, there was a liaison discussion about Miles and Rodriguez at which time your representatives advised that your Bureau planned to interview Miles, on an appropriate pretext, and that there were signs that she might be susceptible to "doubling". We recognize that the Miles Rodriguez case is an internal security responsibility of the Bureau but, to assist us in our efforts to assess Rodriguez as a DGI officer, it would be appreciated if you would provide us with the results of your interview with Miles as well as personality information about him that she may acquire in the future.

3. We would also like to have your comments about considering Rodriguez as a potential penetration of the DGI in Cuba. There is the possibility that Miles might be used to assist in approaching Rodriguez if, for example, she has refused to cooperate as a double agent or later if internal security considerations warrant an approach to Rodriguez.

SUBJECT OF DOCUMENT: Transmittal of Written Contact Report, Play-1414.9570

SOURCE INFORMATION:
SOURCE CRYPTONYM: WUSLAB/1
DATE OF INFO: Meeting on 10 Apr 70; report dated 13 Apr

TEXT OF EXTRACT (Also cite doc: distribution, Dissem. No., etc. if applicable).
Production: WUSLAB/1 said that José Raul Viera Linares had phoned him at his home at about 1100 on 8 April. Viera said that a friend had described to him an acquaintance who had had an eye problem similar to WUSLAB/1 (or words to that effect), and that Viera now realized the seriousness of the case and that WUSLAB/1 would not be able to travel. Viera said that the chances were now remote that he would be returning to New York. A friend of his named "Rogelio" would contact WUSLAB/1. He did not say when or where, but it would be when circumstances permit. WUSLAB/1 asked if Viera might be assigned to another foreign country. Viera did not deign to answer this question.

3. I asked WUSLAB/1 what he considered the possibilities of recruiting Viera were. He thought an important factor would be Viera's liking of comfort and security. He would not be motivated by money, but he did like good living. He also probably did not like living in Havana, and would not like to stay there for a very long period. W/1 thought that if Viera came out to a country such as Spain that contact with him could easily be developed. In the United States Viera was on his guard. Also in the United States Viera did not have high level contacts with the local government, whereas in other countries he would be expected to have such contacts. Some of those contacts might then be also in contact with U.S. officials and you could get a cross-check on Viera. I told WUSLAB/1 that we would finish the PCQ form on Viera the next time we get together.

DISPATCH

Acting COB, New York

SUBJECT: Transmittal of Information on Official Cuban Community in New York

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI, extract to appropriate 201 files and per paragraph 7

1. Transmitted herewith as an attachment to this dispatch are one copy each for C/WH/COG and COS/WH/MIAMI of the 1/1 debriefing results on CMUN and DGI Center personnel and activities in New York. The information was obtained by FIGALAN during a short meeting on 1 February 1970 (the information on Teofilo ACOSTA and "AGEO" was obtained jointly by BETHOORN and FIGALAN). The information was forwarded via Referenced Informatique on Pedro Luis PINERO Eirin (201-824376), Third Secretary and DGI officer, also was cabled, via Referenced C.

2. Copies of the attached have been passed by FIGALAN to the local LNERGO office. "ELGIN" is the local code name used between this Base and LNERGO to designate AMANVIL/1. As addressees will note, the attached abstract on PINERO makes no mention of the DGI affiliation and activities reported by him; rather than make such information a matter of record within LNERGO FIGALAN merely passed such information to LNERGO orally 25 March.

DISPATCH
interest concerning PINERO and photos for cleaning out black
market not only here but elsewhere.

To the attached information on Jose Raul VIERA Linares
(201-328953), Counsellor, Source told the writer that VIERA's
contact within Random House (publishing firm) is one
Jason EPSTEIN (no further bio data available).

5. Re the attached information on Teofilo ACOSTA
(201-340505), First Secretary and DGI officer, and his "war
name" "AGEO", Source told the writer that one of his own romantic involvement
was with a woman named Mildred Ortiz, who is posted at all
times at the New York City General Post Office and delivers
mail to the Cuban UN Mission. Source believes that Mildred
Ortiz is the daughter of a doctor in Havana.

6. Re the attached information on Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez
(201-332665), Source knows of RODRIGUEZ's apartment in
Elmhurst (61-15 97th Street) and has seen it (one morning I
phoned the apartment at 0815 to see if VIERA were there).
Source believes that RODRIGUEZ's involvement in JKLANCE is romantic only;
he is not opposed to PINERO's interest in Mildred Ortiz, per the
attached sheet.

G. Re war-name "AGEO" on the attached sheet, FIGALAN believes
that AMANVIL/1 may be mistaken in that the war name "AGIO" was here as part
of the Cuban Delegation to the UN General Assembly; as related
below, there are possibilities for "AGIO" in both 1967 and 1968.
In 1967 there are the following personalities who could be identical
with "AGEO":
A. Joaquin Camilo GARCIA Alonzo, born 10 August 1937 in
Havana;
B. Gonzalo DIAZ Diaz, born 25 November 1945 in Pinar del
Rio;
C. Pedro Juan BIERAN Veloso, born March 1933 in Las
Villas;
D. Carlos E. ANTELO Porez, born 15 January 1940 in Pinar
del Rio;
E. Gonzalo DEPRUDC Sole (201-720312), born 10 January 1938
in Havana.
In 1968 there are the following personalities who could be identical
with "AGEO":
F. Eduardo ANOZ Agero (201-040126), born 21 March 1930 in
Las Villas;
G. Gonzalo GONZALEZ Custo, born 15 November 1942 in
Havana;
H. Cresconcio E. RAHEINMUNIA Paen, born 14 September 1941
in Havana;

---

14-00000

I. Tomas Vinikumm Lechal, born 30 October 1943 in
Oriente;
J. Pompo Vinikumm Lechal, born 1944 in Oriente;
K. Julian Tompus Mizo, born 1 October 1944 in Havana.
We have been unable to link any member of the UN Delegations for 1967 and 1968 with "AGEO"
because they are too numerous and/or we do not know them sufficiently to rule out the possibility that
one of them corresponds to the "AGEO" that AMANVIL/1 has in mind. We feel that the two likely
candidates are Eduardo Anoz Agero (201-040126) and Carlos E. Antelo
Perez. The latter was born in 1940; ARAOZ here in 1930. We feel that
Howard Antelo
they are identical with "AGEO".
Should addressees be able to shed any light on the true
identity of "AGEO" we would be most interested. Even if this is not
possible, probably we will know eventually who he is should his
assignment here materialize.

8. The attached sheets should be extracted to the appropriate 201 files. To facilitate this the 201 numbers are listed below:
Orlando PEREIRA Gonzalez (201-848505)
Pedro Luis PINERO Eirin (201-824376)
Jose Raul VIERA Linares (201-328953)
Orlando PRENDES Gutierrez (201-330002)
Ricardo ALARCON Quesada (201-347590)

Howard G. FIGALAN

---

14-00000

Subjectively, Source considers that the most vulnerable of the CMUN personnel are Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, Ambassador ALARCON, and Pedro Amado MORALES Carballo. RODRIGUEZ because he likes the ladies and the material things in life; ALARCON because of his strained relationship with PRENDES; and MORALES because he is basically a good sort and a realistic person. As stated, this is subjective reasoning on Source's part.

8. Replacement Personnel. With VIERA and PINERO leaving soon, there is talk in Havana about assigning one Teofilo ACOSTA here as a replacement for one or the other. ACOSTA is a negro in his early 30s and has served in several African posts for the DGI (including Tanzania and Mozambique). ACOSTA has been protected by Manuel PINEIRO Losada, former DGI chief, but is disliked by most MINREX types who know him. Source described ACOSTA as a sly and suspicious person who would not hesitate to report on anyone, including his friends and neighbors. ACOSTA is believed to have been deeply involved in various "wars of liberation" in Africa. ACOSTA was originally under consideration as a replacement for Francisco PORTELA, the Prensa Latina chief in New York, but it was finally decided to leave PORTELA here as there were advantages to his being a U.S. citizen.

Source also mentioned that one "AGEO" (a war name; real name not known to Source) was under consideration for assignment here. Source said that "AGEO" was a member of the Cuban Delegation to the 22nd UN General Assembly in 1967 (date possibly not correct). This "AGEO" was in charge of the purge within MINREX in 1967 which resulted in the ouster of some 300 persons regarded as homosexuals, counter-revolutionaries, or incompetents.

INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM SOURCE "ELGIN" ON 6 OCTOBER 1969
CUBAN UN MISSION PERSONALITIES

Pedro Amado MORALES Carballo, Counsellor. Source stated that MORALES has no intelligence/security affiliation. He is close to Fidel CASTRO Ruz. He is very frivolous", not a serious type of person. Although MORALES is an Alternate Representative on the II Committee of the UNGA, he knows little about the issues or the work of the Committee. He has intellectual pretenses, but in actuality is of somewhat limited intellectual capacity. Does not take his work seriously. Source termed him a "tonto". Source is not aware whether MORALES has had any contacts with Cyrus EATON since MORALES' arrival here.

Julio ALOM Gil, First Secretary. Source stated that ALOM has no intelligence/security affiliation. ALOM is very close to Ambassador Ricardo ALARCON Quesada.

Orlando PEREIRA Gonzalez, First Secretary. Source stated that PEREIRA is a DGI officer. He speaks a "little" Russian learned when he was assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Moscow. PEREIRA is a close associate of Manuel PINEIRO Losada, Chief of the DGI. PEREIRA is the DGI replacement for Jesus JIMENEZ Escobar, former CMUN Counsellor; however, JIMENEZ' diplomatic replacement is Pedro Amado MORALES Carballo. Source does not personally like PEREIRA. Just before PEREIRA was assigned to New York he married Maria de los Angeles LOPEZ Canas. Until her marriage, LOPEZ served as secretary to the Chief of the Cuban Communist Youth Organization. She now works part-time in the CMUN as a teletype operator.

Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, First Secretary. RODRIGUEZ is a bachelor, which Source stated is rare among DGI personnel assigned abroad. Source stated that RODRIGUEZ has a frank and open manner, also rare among DGI personnel.

Florentino JIMENEZ Padron, Attache. Source stated that JIMENEZ has no intelligence/security affiliation. He is the CMUN chauffeur. Member of the Cuban Communist Party. A "campesino" type. Came to the Foreign Ministry as a chauffeur from the Cuban Armed Forces. JIMENEZ enjoys good personal relations with Foreign Minister Raul ROA, and is under ROA's "protection". During his assignment at the Cuban Embassy in Prague, JIMENEZ initiated a one-time sexual liaison with a local woman with

---

14-00000

the approval of the DGI Center. He continued the liaison, however, and the DGI Center complained to the Foreign Ministry; ROA bailed JIMENEZ out!

Serafin A Rodriquez, Attache. GARCIA (who had arrived here in February 1969) has departed permanently from New York for Cuba

Pedro Luis PINERO Eirin, Third Secretary. Source stated that PINERO and Lohania Josefina ARUCA Alonso, member of the Cuban UNGA Delegation, of late are always together, day and night. Marta JIMENEZ Martinez commented that one time Lohania did not return to her room until 0100 hours in the morning after having been with PINERO. Source assumes that PINERO and ARUCA are having an affair. (In 1967, during the UNGA, ARUCA and Nicolas RODRIGUEZ Astiazarain, then CMUN Counsellor, were romantically involved; ARUCA expected RODRIGUEZ to divorce his wife and marry her - he didn't).

Justo Cesar GELABERT Martinez, Attache. Source was told by Jorge REYES Vega, Second Secretary, that GELABERT and his wife, Neida BLANDY Reyes, returned to Cuba at the direction of the CMUN because BLANDY was behaving promiscuously ("como una prostituta"). They plan to divorce. Source doubts that GELABERT will return to New York. Source did not know the person or persons with whom Neida BLANDY was sexually misbehaving. Source said that REYES commented to him that GELABERT appeared to be afraid of BLANDY.

MISCELLANEOUS
(A) Source continues to regard Orlando PRENDES Gutierrez, First Secretary and Chief of the local DGI Center, as a very "simpatico" person. He also thinks well of Teresita FERNANDEZ Arango, PRENDES' wife, as a person. PRENDES spends little time outside of the CMUN. As Chief of the DGI Center he concerns himself principally with administration of the Center's personnel and operational activities, leaving conduct of actual operations to his subordinates

(B) Source thinks that Jose Raul VIERA Linares, Counsellor, may be acting as the deputy to PRENDES. At any rate, after PRENDES, the three ranking DGI personnel are VIERA, Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, and Orlando PEREIRA Gonzalez (not necessarily in that order).

SANTANA Fraiz, Attache, is very interested in electronics. SANTANA is a "disagreeable person" and speaks little. Source is not sure whether SANTANA is with the DGI or the DSE.

INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM SOURCE "ELGIN" ON 6 OCTOBER 1969
CUBAN UNGA DELEGATION PERSONALITIES

Fernando ALVAREZ Tabio, Ambassador, and Enrique CARBO Argudin, Advisor, are staying together in the Peter Cooper Hotel. Marta JIMENEZ Martinez, Minister, Maria de los Angeles FLORES Prida, First Secretary, and Lohania Josefina ARUCA Alonso, First Secretary, are staying together at the Peter Cooper Hotel. Roberto Miguel FERNANDEZ Vasquez, Antonio Bruno FERNANDEZ, and Victor Manuel GONZALEZ Valdez, all Advisors, have moved from the Peter Cooper and are now staying in the apartment of Justo Cesar GELABERT Martinez, #5 M, 220 East 63rd Street. (It is possible that one of the Cuban diplomatic couriers is also staying in the GELABERT apartment as well).

DELEGATION ADVISORS. All of the "Advisors" on the Delegation are with the DGI. Ramon OROZA Naveran, Manuel MARTINEZ Galan, and Raul Coferi ZAYAS Linares have gone to Canada to "inspect" the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa; from there they will return to Cuba via Mexico. They do not plan to return to New York enroute home. Source thinks that the other three Advisors FERNANDEZ, FERNANDEZ, and GONZALEZ will remain in New York until the end of the UNGA. They are currently taking English lessons for several hours most mornings (place not known to Source). Source considers that these three are all "disagreeable" people very reserved and not at all friendly. Source considers Roberto FERNANDEZ Vasquez to be a "sinvergüenza".

Carlos OLIVARES Sanchez, formerly Cuban Ambassador to the Soviet Union and formerly a high ranking official of the Foreign Ministry, may attend a later portion of the UNGA. OLIVARES is in Boston to have an eye operation at Massachusetts General Hospital. He may stop off in New York enroute back to Cuba. OLIVARES' influence in Cuba has been waning ever since Fidel CASTRO began replacing the "Old Guard Communists" with "Fidelistas".
