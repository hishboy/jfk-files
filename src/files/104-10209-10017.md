1. A source who has given highly reliable information in the past, and whom we have no reason to question, has stated that during 1943 one Luis TEDESCHI was either being considered for recruitment by/or was actually working for the RIS. According to the source, he was known to have been active as a member of the Spanish Communist Party. The address used by TEDESCHI during early 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

2. The Buenos Aires Station has determined that a Luis TEDESCHI, born 2 February 1918, is listed in local police files as living at El Domador 3150, telephone 58-3717. Further investigation is being conducted there. Unfortunately, Headquarters does not have the date and place of birth of Subject of paragraph 1. The source has indicated that Subject was probably born in Italy and may have been active in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39. This, of course, could explain his involvement in the Spanish Communist Party.

3. It is requested that Rome, Barcelona, and Madrid check Station and Base files for any traces of Subject. Liaison and police contacts may be approached for any information available in their files.

SUBJECT: Luis TEDESCHI

1. This office is extremely interested in obtaining all available information on one Luis TEDESCHI, who was reported to be residing at Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires, Argentina in the early part of 1943, at which time he allegedly was of interest to the RIS. The attached document refers to a Luis TEDESCHI residing at this address in 1942 and to an individual by the name of TELESCHI who had resided at Estados Unidos 6366 in 1942. Apparently the information as shown on the attached document was obtained through mail intercepts.

2. We would appreciate having you tell us if you know of any way we might locate the intercepts referred to and possibly any other intercepts directed to TEDESCHI ie the U.S. Office of Censorship.

HABA-9016 of 4 November 1960

1. Headquarters regrets that it has been unable to learn the date and place of birth of the Luis TEDESCHI who, according to a usually reliable source, was being considered for recruitment in 1943 by the RIS, or was actually working for the RIS. As stated in HA-6515, our source reported that the address used by TEDESCHI during the early part of 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires.

2. Collateral information on Luis TEDESCHI of Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires, has been found in a 1942 document which appears to have been based on censorship reports. This document indicates that TEDESCHI's address, as given above, was a cover address for a UDE (Union Democratica Espanola) manifesto sent from Cuba. Also one TEDESCHI, Estados Unidos 6366, Buenos Aires, was given as a cover address in a secret writing message. A copy of the pertinent portions of this document is attached.

3. It is hoped that a unilateral surveillance on the Luis TEDESCHI living at El Domador 3150, Buenos Aires, if instituted as the station planned, will be fruitful. Headquarters will be extremely interested in any further information on this individual you may be able to develop, as it is possible that he may be linked with Communist and/or RIS activities in Cuba as well as being used locally by the RIS.

4. As KUDESK is currently handling this case, it is requested that the slug REDWOOD not be used.

REPORT No.350

Results of our first conversation with a young man from TORRELAVEGA, SANTANDER, about 28 years old. At the beginning of the war he was in the army in MOROCCO and spent the whole war in Franco's army. He comes from a family of small garage-owners. Neither he nor any of his family have belonged to any political party or syndicate although his sympathies have always been on the left.

SPANISH ATTITUDE TO THE REGIME AND THE WAR. He says that the immense majority of the Spanish people is against Franco and the Falange, workers, peasants, employees, bourgeois, big and small and a large proportion of the soldiers and the Requet√©s. He says that everyone hopes for the victory of the Allies. In it there is a blind trust, especially when the U.S. entered the war and the U.S. and England are the most powerful countries in the world, especially with the assistance of Russia. Only the Falangists desire and plan for the victory of Hitler, even though there are many Falangists too who take a very black view of him". He says the majority of people sympathise with England. They have complete faith in the victory of the Democracies. There are supporters of the USSR, but the immense majority, according to our informant, do not like "communism" and prefer Democracy. He is obviously rather muddled by the Falangist propaganda against the U.S.S.R. He says that the entrance of the U.S.S.R. into the war gave rise to happiness all over the world, although there had been a great deal of confusion before, through the Treaty of Aid between Russia and Germany. But this confusion disappeared with German aggression against the U.S.S.R. He says that the German defeats on the Russian front raised morals and renewed everyone's confidence in victory. Hitler's admission in his speech of how much they had suffered in Russia in winter, and that they were on the edge of catastrophe, produced great joy among the people. He says that the entry of the U.S. into the War caused a very good impression; and increased people's confidence in victory although Pearl Harbour caused some demoralisation. He says that no one wishes Spain to enter the war, except the Falangists. Franco does not wish it

himself; and desires neutrality but since those who command are Serrano Suner and the Falangists, Franco has no choice but to do what Hitler orders him, and there is serious danger of war for Spain. He says that the Anglo-Soviet and the Soviet-American pact are known through the Falangist press which has spoken of them. They made a very good impression on the people. Asked if he knew that the said pact stipulated that after the victory nations would have freedom to decide their destinies without foreign interference, he says yes, the press published it. About the Second Front he says that everyone thinks of it, and is hoping for it to open if possible through Spain. That the day they disembark, all the people will rise. Asked what the people would do in case of a landing in France, he said that his opinion was that if that happened the Spanish people would rise, even though the invasion was not on their coasts. The agreement about the Second Front is also known. He says the people who are most fervent supporters of the Nazis are Serrano Suner, Primero de Rivera, and a certain Count whose name he does not know. He often says that he knows nothing of politics, because he only read the sports news in the papers and did not want to know anything about the Falange. He says that there are many preparations for war; they are making fortifications on the coasts of Galicia and placing a considerable amount of artillery there. He says that the political force of the Falange and the syndicates is "artificial": everyone hates them. The people belong to the syndicate because they can't help it, but they do not pay their dues or take them seriously. Discontent has even reached the ranks of the Falange. Many clerks, students, and people who joined it thinking they "were going to steal the music" are now very discontented, and do not pay their dues, and when they are threatened with being expelled they say that is what they are waiting for, for the Falange to play at "fisticuffs". There are many officers in the army who are not in agreement with the Falange or the idea that Spain is to go to war. The most violent opposition comes from Queipo de Llano and Yague. No one knows where Queipo is going and Yague is thought to be in exile in the Prov. of Pontevedra. Both were cashiered, Queipo for protesting against food leaving for Germany and Yague because in a speech at Zaragoza, he said - "we do desire a great and free Spain, but without any Blue Shirts, Red Shirts, or prisoners."

All the sergeants say that they are very discontented, because they earn 5 pts. which keeps them very short and of the soldiers he says-"in a word they are hungry, many years in barracks, and then the danger that they might be sent to war". He says that they are well-uniformed, just as well as before the war. They have dismissed the 1941 Draft. He thinks that there was very little sympathy for the Division Azul and the people laughed at those who volunteered. 40% were forced to go, others went because they were hungry, and there were few volunteers. He says that survivors came back in a state of panic, there was a lack of food and equipment, several of them mutilated themselves in order to escape from this inferno. All say that the Russians are very well-armed and fight with great courage.

HELP TO THE NAZIS. He says that his opinion is that a great deal of food is taken to Germany, although he can give no details, but if there is no food and olive oil in Spain where is it? He says that in Torrelavega the "Fabrica Continental" is working at high pressure, making tyre covers, while in Spain transport is held up for want of them.

THE CHURCH. He says that it is not true that in the Church there are anti-German and Anti-Falangist groups. The supporters of the Regime are the Falange, the Germans and the Clergy, in that order. The Church wishes for the triumph of Germany, in spite of her anti-Catholic policy because they believe that in that case they will be able to preserve their position of influence. He says that English and Russian news can be heard although it is very difficult and is forbidden although there is no watch or inspection. He says that everybody is against the Falange and submissions to Germany, including the monarchists and the rich on whom the Falangists impose large fines for racketeering. Many of the monarchists, bourgeois etc. are on the side of England. Democracy is considered as a possible substitute for the Regime. A democratic Republic like there was before the war. A Regime of peace and work. Speaking of the solution of the present situation, he says that they want a regime of peace and not a revolution: That he contradicts himself by saying that it will not be achieved by peaceful means. He says that this would be the best but that the deaths, the betrayals, the crimes must be avenged.

The people are very united and there are not the old differences between the parties of the Frente Popular. The policy of National Union is unknown, he has heard no one speak of it.

DETAILS OF THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE He says that he thinks that secret organisations function, especially in Bilbao and he says particularly "It is a city of brave men". He says that notices painted on the walls are often seen there. He only remembers one "Less Franco, more white bread". Asked if the notices were signed by any party he says no, because it would give away the people who had done it. He says that he knows, because he was told, that in Bilbao there were illegal pamphlets and even a newspaper in circulation, but he does not know their content. He thinks that there must have been a clandestine press, but as he was never an idealist the people who did those things would not trust him, and as he is out of everything he does not know any details". He says he thinks that the people working in Bilbao are nationalists and communists, especially the latter. That a few months ago two Italian submarines, badly damaged by English planes, came into Santander. Two hundred persons were arrested for discussing this, and many people thought that the second front had already begun. He gives no more details.

He says that Serrano Suner was the object of an attack in Madrid when he met Arrese, and when the latter tried to protect Suner he was seriously wounded and had to undergo a critical operation. Asked if he thought there was sabotage etc., he says no- the disorganisation of the train services is due to all the employees being new and not knowing their business.

GUERILLEROS He says that "El Carinoso" was working in Santander and "The Railwaymen" too; that "El Carinoso" came from Hargames and had his headquarters in Santander. That he was recently killed through quarrels and imbroglios caused by his girlfriend who was from the J.C. and had another lover, and it was he who was arrested at the same time as El Carinoso. It was he who informed against them all. Many people love the Guerilleros, although there are many people who help them through fear, as for example a relation of his from whom they took his only pig, but in general the Guerilleros behave excellently. "El Carinoso" was once in Barcelona, where he went in a cab to get his teeth fixed. El Carinoso was not a politician but took to the mountains in order to avenge the death of his cousin who was assassinated by the Falange. That they often, like the guerilleros of Asturias, disguised themselves as Civil Guard, went down to the villages, and arrested the Falanists. But where there are most Guerilleros, and the most active, is in Asturias. Six months ago, about three hundred guerilleros were ready to embark on the coast in order to leave Spain. But there was a quarrel and a terrific fight between these guerilleros and the forces of authority, with many dead, and after that they retreated to the mountains. He says that the politicians who are most popular are Prieto and Asana. Some speeches of Prieto's have been circulated through Bilbao, but he does not know what they say. There is also in circulation an article, reproduced from an English paper, reprinted by an employes in the Real Comp. Asturiana, de Ins. Republicana. The article refers to the powers and resources of the Allies and their chances of victory. He says he does not know of any activity of the communists, that this is obviously the activity of other people who are not communists; that for example the man who reprinted the article and those who read it were all on the Republican Left, and if there is any communist activity it is so camouflaged that no one knows who is the author. He says that during the crossing they were detained by the English in Bermuda and in Baltimore by the Americans. That the English made a short examination, they did not interrogate them in front of everybody and left them the letters they carried. In Baltimore they were interrogated one by one and were asked about fortifications, food, if they sent it to Germany, etc. When our informant said he had been in Franco's army up to the war they asked him why he did not desert to the Republican army.

SOLIDARITY. He says there is no organisation for solidarity, that this only exists between groups of friends who have a relation or acquaintance in prison. They are not allowed to visit the prisoners more than once a week. He says that the killing goes on, and that in Vigo, a few days before he left, a lieutenant of the Civil Guard was shot for having gone for a walk alone at his own risk.

REPORT No.351

MARIA RODRIGUEZ, about 29 years old. Comes from a comfortably-off peasant family in the Province of Orense. She is very sluggish and at every question repeats that she does not know and that women do not understand many things. She had only a little more than an hour to spare as she was busy in the evening and had to leave for the interior in the morning.

WAR She says that she was surprised when she arrived in Havana as she thinks there is more enthusiasm in Spain than here and more confidence in an American victory. The peasants "like everyone else" would like the "American" to win, even those on the Right are sure the Germans will lose. She cannot explain the nature of Franco's assistance to Hitler, she says only that "as it was the Germans who won, Spain owes them more than it has". She cannot be explicit, either, about the dangers of war, but she says that Franco's soldiers, the young men in general, and as a concrete instance a brother of hers served five years in Franco's army, say that they will go up into the mountain and shoot before going again to the war. About the Division Azul she knows only that when it was first formed a volunteer left from her district. He was an outlaw who had committed crimes and she says that he went through fear of the consequences. The people do not like the Blue Division. They were not asked for anything for the "volunteers".

FUTURE PROSPECTS She insists that there is great confidence that it will soon change. So much so that a Republican who was hidden for years and afterwards discovered told her to tell her husband "Do not leave because things will soon change" The village has a hundred inhabitants, and she says that they all hope it will change; but from what we can gather this confidence is based entirely on an Allied victory. She says that if the English opened a second front in Spain the people would revolt, but she says she has heard no opinions on this point. The people speak without fear. She relates that the Falangists tried to take a pistol from her father and that he hid it. They threatened him, they took him in a car telling him that they were going to knock his head off, but the old man remained firm, telling them to do what they liked. They did not do anything to him nor did they get the pistol. As an example of solidarity against the Falange the old man said he had sold the pistol to a man who was going to America. They told him to prove it, the old brought as witnesses two peasants who lived more than a league away, without having agreed on a story first, but being quite convinced that the peasants when they saw the Falangists, if only for the sake of contradicting them, would say that what he said was true. A little later they sent him a notice for a Falangist meeting and he refused to go. She does not know if the other peasants did.

ARMY She knows that a short time ago they dismissed the 56 (1956) Draft. Her husband was on service in Orense and deserted and went to Cuba. Immediately the Captain of the Company and a lieutenant went to his house to make inquiries. His brother told them "In his circumstances I do not know what I would have done", and the captain and the lieutenant went away saying - "He is right".

PEASANTS. As we have already said, she belongs to a family which is comfortably off, they have several labourers in their employ. She says that the day labourers, and the farmer are equally against the Government and the Germans. To illustrate the situation she says that the daily wage is 20 pts. without food, and 8 with food. They all prefer the 5 and food, because otherwise they have nothing to eat. The peasants are very discontented, and show it openly to the Falangist officials when they come to inspect the harvest and when they fix the prices, saying "They have no right to do it, it is an abuse", but it appears that it goes no further then this. They have not requisitioned anything but they force them to sell to the official buyers who issue permits to authorised buyers. These individuals take the produce to large shops and amass real fortunes. A quintal of potatoes, they have to sell at 30 pta. and they are sold afterwards by the dealers at the standard rate of four or five ptas: the kilo, that is to say at a 800% profit, to private people who require them. And if the peasants take their produce to the market they have to sell it at the standard rate to the dealers. No peasant takes any rye to the market, they prefer to run the risk of selling it to private people. This is the only way in which they can

14-00000

8/4612

get other products. They have imposed a new tax; they have to pay 15 centimes for each vinestock. They have given up the "one-dish meal" and they are not forced to contribute to Auxilio Social. She says that the Government does not know what is going on in the country. They distribute the sulphate, not according to the number of vineyards, not even according to the number of inhabitants, so that her district which is wine country, gets less sulphate than the next one and produces very little wine, although it has more inhabitants. A kilo of sulphate is worth 39 ptas. before it was worth 50 centimes. She says that they were taking a few things to America and they made them pay in Pialato, in Orense, and in Vigo, and if they had passed through more provinces they would have had to pay again.

REPORT No.352

Information volunteered by three Galician peasants, not members of political parties. They remained throughout the war in Franquist territory, although only one of them fought in the army. Very backward politically, anti-franquist, and more anti-Falangist. With the exception of one who was in Asturias as a soldier, the others never left their village which is a hamlet in Galicia.

SPANISH ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AGAINST HITLER. The majority of the Spanish people with the exception of the very rich and the Falangista are against Franco and the Falange. They explain that Falangists see what is coming to them through the crimes they have committed, and they are the people who really wish for a German victory, with the object of saving their skins, and the money they have stolen from the people. In Spain, in general, no one wants the war, since they are exhausted, according to our informants, except for the Falangists. It is said that Franco is a partisan of neutrality, and daily visits the British Ambassador at his private residence and has interviews with him. In spite of this they say there is a danger of Spain being rushed into the war against her will, because in Spain the Germans are the masters. All the world believes that the Allies will be the victors except the Falange. Before the attack on Russia many people were demoralised by the German advances and began to "think them invincible". When Russia entered the war, enthusiasm and confidence in Hitler's defeat increased enormously, but that was especially when the Russian victories began. They say: "I do not know what would have happened to us but for Russia; the Nazis would be masters of the world. They also say that the Nazi army will not stand another winter of war, that they have suffered such losses that the next Russian winter offensive will defeat them although there is no talk of a Second Front. They are sure that the Democracies will win the war. They admire the resistance of the U.S.S.R. They say that Germany has already lost the war as a consequence of the losses suffered in Russia. The entrance of the U.S. into the war contributed to increase the already existing confidence in victory. They do not know of the Anglo-Soviet and Soviet-American agreements, nor the agreement about the second front. One of our informants asked us what "O Hitler 1942" meant and when we told him he said that they also said it in Spain, because in order to achieve it it was necessary to open a second front. They think that if there was a landing in France the people would rise. They also say that there are rumours that they land in Galicia and in this case the whole of Galicia would revolt to help the Allies. The same thing would happen in any part of Spain.

The "DIVISION AZUL" is hated by the majority of the people. They say that the majority have been forced to volunteer, and explain how the recruiting is done. Anyone who does not want to go and fight Communism, take a step forward. Some enlisted because of the desperate situation they were in. Some enlisted, too, because they were stalwart Falangists. When the recruits left the province a great many people went to see them off, calling them "sons of bitches" and insulting their mothers. When one contingent of "Volunteers" came back from the Russian front at Irun they had to leave the train because the people were stoning them. Many people came back maimed and with frostbite. They tell terrible stories about the Germans and the horrors of the war. They say the Russians are very brave and fight with great courage. That they have large supplies of ammunition, and that things on the Russian front are not like the papers said they were. They said that the food on the Russian front was very scarce and bad. It was sent to them from Spain and they suffered many hardships. They all wished to return to Spain as soon as possible; they repented of having enlisted.

8/4612

HELP GIVEN BY THE FRANQUIST REGIME AND THE FALANGE TO HITLER. Now and then they send reinforcements to the Division Azul in groups of a thousand or one thousand five hundred. They say that in order to replace the casualties and those who return crippled. Even the Falangists themselves say - "the Russian front is a very serious matter". Those who are recruited to replace losses in Russia are recruited by force, by the process already mentioned. All airmen have to serve some months on the Eastern front as "training". They say that lately they were training about 150 pilots to send them to Russia. The war factories are working at high pressure. The Germans are directing the erection of an aerodrome in the province of Lugo. In Galicia very few Germans are to be seen. Military instruction is obligatory for boys and youths in the "Frente de la Juventud". They also train youths from 15 onwards to serve in aviation. A friend of the informants told them that there passed daily through a city in the North fifty cars loaded wit war material in the direction of the French frontier. German submarines refuel at Redondela and Vigo. He says that English aeroplanes often make reconnaissance flights over the harbours of Galicia. They describe Serrano Suner as the most subservient to the Nazis and in general to the Falangists who have crimes behind them or who have become rich through robbing the people.
