SUBJECT: VIDEO TAPE - PFC WHITE

1. ENROUTE TO YOUR LOCATION IS A VIDEO TAPE COPY OF THE TELEVISED
NORTH KOREAN PRESS CONFERENCE PFC WHITE HELD IN PYONGYANG.

2. THE TAPE IS BEING HANDCARRIED BY LTC ROBERT TURPIN, 074-26-2297,
USA. LTC TURPIN IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT
AT 2155 LOCAL, 8 SEPTEMBER, ON TWA FLIGHT 240.

3. REQUEST AN OFFICER FROM YOUR OFFICE MEET HIM UPON HIS ARRIVAL.
HE IS DRESSED IN SHORT SLEEVE CLASS A UNIFORM.

4. LTC TURPIN HAS RESERVATIONS AT THE HOLIDAY INN, NEXT TO MILPER-
CEN HQ IN ALEXANDRIA, SHOULD HE BE MISSED AT THE AIRPORT.

5. TAPE MUST BE CONSIDERED CLOSE HOLD NOW, BUT, DO NOT OBJECT TO
PERMITTING PARENTS TO VIEW IT UNDER DA CONTROL WITHOUT PRESS INVOLVE-
MENT. NEWS MEDIA MAY HAVE TAPED INTERVIEW AND SEEMS BEST TO GIVE
PARENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW FROM OUR SOURCE FIRST RATHER THAN THEM
SEEING IT ON EVENINGS NEWS. PARENTS SHOULD BE REQUESTED TO NOT DIS-
CUSS THE TAPE OR ITS CONTENTS WITH NEWS MEDIA, AS SUCH ACTION MIGHT
JEOPARDIZE OUR 13 SEPTEMBER EFFORTS TO TRY AND ARRANGE A FACE TO FACE
INTERVIEW WITH WHITE.

6. USE OF THE TAPE IN CONNECTION WITH NEWS MEDIA MUST BE CAREFULLY
CONSIDERED. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD DA ALLOW
THE PRESS TO VIEW THE TAPE WITHOUT EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE PARENTS.
TO DO OTHERWISE VIOLATES COMMON COURTESY. MOREOVER, THE TAPE WAS NOT
PRODUCED BY DOD FOR RELEASE BUT HAS SIMPLY FALLEN INTO OUR POSSESSION
AND THUS PRESS HAS NO UP FRONT RIGHT TO IT, THE INTERVIEW WILL NOT

BE SHOWN ON SOUTH KOREAN TV AND IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE US
NOT TO AID NORTH KOREA IN SPREADING THEIR COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.
OFFERING TO PROVIDE A SCREENING OR COPIES OF THE TAPE WILL PROVIDE
THE NORTH KOREANS WITH A MUCH LARGER AUDIENCE THAN THEY MAY OTHER-
WISE ACHIEVE. COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO DOWN-
PLAY THE INCIDENT AND LIMIT THE PUBLICITY WILL FRUSTRATE COMMUNISTS
EFFORTS TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE. IF FEELING AT DA IS THAT TAPE
SHOULD BE TURNED OVER TO PRESS, URGE TJAG AND/OR GENERAL COUNCIL
BECOME INVOLVED TO RULE ON THE NECESSITY TO DO SO.

7. PLEASE RESPOND WHEN THE TAPE IS IN YOUR POSSESSION.

8. WARM REGARDS.

SSO NOTE: DELIVER IMMEDIATELY
