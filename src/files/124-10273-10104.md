DATE: 3/15/67

SUBJECT: CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO
DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR,
RELEASE OF CIA INFORMATION
IN THIS DOCUMENT.

In connection with developments in the case [NK 2264-S,] [IS-R, Bureau file 134-9824,] the Director noted "I note more and more we are telling CIA about our domestic operations and always to our detriment. I want this trend stopped." (A separate memorandum is being submitted concerning a new development in the aforementioned case).

On 3/15/67, the Liaison Agent met with Richard Helms, Director, CIA, and took the opportunity to review the status of relations between FBI and CIA. It was felt that this was an opportune time to do so in view of the Director's concern as expressed above.

Helms stated that he personally was pleased with relations between the two Agencies. He stated that sometimes he is irked or disturbed when people outside and inside of the Government ask the question "How are you getting along with the FBI?" He indicated that this question is frequently asked by members of Congress. Helms stated that he religiously has followed a practice of lucidly and firmly advising such people that relations are excellent. He stated that he personally believed that this was true.

The Liaison Agent commented that working relations are good, but there was an area which might not be getting proper attention. The Agent stated that there was reason to be concerned regarding effective coordination on those cases which are of interest to both FBI and CIA because there appeared to be developing an atmosphere where people in both Agencies felt that there was now wide-open liberty to conduct operations and activities of a joint nature. The Agent stated that he wished to emphasize that such an atmosphere cannot exist and that Mr. Hoover would never condone any trend in this direction. The Agent commented that work in this area had to be very efficiently coordinated and that we in the Bureau were closely scrutinizing each situation as it develops where both Agencies had an interest. The Agent suggested that Mr. Helms might desire to alert appropriate subordinates in the Agency on this point.

RELEASE OF CIA INFORMATION
IN THIS DOCUMENT.

On 3/15/67, PSI EMIL R. SVEILIS, the late night desk editor, United Press International, Washington, D. C. who has furnished reliable information in the past, said that he wished to advise this office that he overheard comments indicating that CIA had contributed at least one million dollars to the National Council of Churches. He also advised that he understood that the CIA maintains a "safe house" at the Airlie House, Warrenton, Virginia. He was questioned specifically about the source of the above information and indicated that he believed that he heard this information from individuals connected with the news media but he could not recall the exact identity of these individuals. He indicated that he got the impression that this information was common knowledge in the news field.

The Bureau may wish to advise CIA by appropriate channels concerning the information that the CIA had allegedly contributed money to the National Council of Churches and maintains a "safe house" at Warrenton, Virginia. This information was not put in LHM form because of its general character and because the PSI was unable to recall his source of this information or when the information came to his attention.

The PSI requested that his identity be protected.

FROM: W. O. Cregar
DATE: 4/4/67

SUBJECT: CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)
ALIEN INTERVIEW REQUESTS

Re memorandum Cotter to Sullivan dated 3/28/67 which instructed the Liaison Agent to advise appropriate CIA representatives of the change in handling alien interview requests at the Bureau.

On 3/31/67, the Liaison Agent advised [Mr. Leo Dunn] of the change in handling [alien interview requests] at FBI Headquarters. [Dunn] was advised that the overall coordination for handling these requests would be handled by the Bureau's Name Check Section under the coordination of Special Agent J. W. Brown.

Inasmuch as CIA occasionally makes a telephonic request when expedite matters are involved, the Liaison Agent obtained the names of Eugene Young and Becky Vaughn as the persons who would call Special Agent Brown in the event an expedite matter is involved. CIA is well aware that the use of this telephonic request should be held to a minimum and used only at times when time is of the essence and the matter is of sufficient importance to deviate from the normal request procedures.

The above is directed to the Name Check Section for their information and attention.
