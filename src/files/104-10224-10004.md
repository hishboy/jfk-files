NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE
Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his
work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater re-
sponsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining
future personnel actions.

Mr. Kimsey possesses a wealth of knowledge in his technical field which, when
skillfully and tactfully utilized, helps to increase the productive capability of his
Section's activities.

This thorough knowledge of A&R activities enables him to present his oral
briefings in an informative and interesting manner.
Subject has been downgraded in Specific Duty #1 from a "4" to a "3". The
basis for the lower rating in this category warrants the following explanation. There
have been numerous and reoccurring complaints from personnel under his supervision
that he does not display a complete respect for their professional capabilities. This
weakness has definitely decreased the morale of the personnel under his supervision.
Mr. Marzen, Chief, TSD/GARB, has discussed all areas of weaknesses with the
Ratee and pointed out how they affect the overall work aspects of this section of
TSD/GARB.
