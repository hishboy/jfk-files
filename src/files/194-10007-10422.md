4.  REPORT OF FINDINGS:

(MISCELLANEOUS) On 14 April 1970, Harfez Muneer, also known as Tony Muneer, Desk Clerk, Hotel Strand, 206 West 43rd Street, New York, New York 10036, residing at Room 301, Hotel Woodstock, 127 West 43rd Street, New York, New York 10036, was interviewed at his residence in an attempt to identify Richard Nagell's current address, business connections, physical description and to query Muneer as to why Nagell was allegedly instrumental in getting Victor L. TRINKALA separated from the military service and how Nagell was able to do so. Source stated in substance as follows:

Muneer knew Richard Nagell as a former United States Army Officer, Captain Richard C. Nagell and first met him in 1966, while both, Source and Nagel, were serving sentences at the Federal Prison (FP) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. From 1966 to 27 November 1968, when Source was released from the FP, Source saw SUBJECT daily on a friendly basis as a fellow inmate. While at the FP, Nagell told Source that he was a former United States Army Captain, and had been an investigator for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) or the CIC (Counterintelligence Corps), further details unknown. According to Nagell, while he was working for the above mentioned agency, Nagell was directly involved with the investigation of the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, and while on business in a bank in El Paso, Texas, Nagell was arrested by the civilian authorities and charged with some kind of felony involving traveler checks, further details unknown. As a result of this arrest, Nagell was convicted and confined to the FP at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

On 27 November 1968, Source was released from the FP and since then had seen Nagell on approximately four occasions on a friendly and social basis. Source last saw Nagell at the Hotel Strand sometime in December 1969. Muneer was unable to furnish any information concerning Nagell's present business connections or whereabouts. Sometime in 1969, exact date unrecalled, Nagell gave Source the following mailing address: Mr. Richard C. Nagell, P. O. Box 2337, Grand Central Station, New York, New York 10017. Source did not know if Nagell's mailing address is still valid.

Source furnished the following physical description of Nagell:

Nationality: United States citizen
Age: Approximately 31 or 32 years old
Race: Caucasian
Height: 6'1" to 6'2"

1.  NAME OF SUBJECT OR TITLE OF INCIDENT:
    TRINKALA, Victor L.
    DPOB: 28 November 1950; Rochester, Pa.
    PVT 186 42 1155
2.  DATE SUBMITTED: 16 April 1970
3.  CONTROL SYMBOL OR FILE NUMBER: 9321 - 6006
4.  REPORT OF FINDINGS:

(MISCELLANEOUS-Continued)

Color of Hair: Brown
Color of Eyes: Unknown
Physical Defects: None; however, while at the FP at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Nagell was believed to have had a physical defect which was corrected, further details unknown. Nagell does not wear glasses or a mustache and he is always clean shaven.

Sometime in 1968, while Source was on duty as a Desk Clerk at the Strand Hotel from 1600 to 2400 hours, SUBJECT came to the hotel desk and requested that Source allow HIM to sleep at the hotel that night since SUBJECT was from out of town and did not have any money to rent a room. Source offered his room at the Woodstock Hotel for that night, which SUBJECT accepted. Since then, Source and SUBJECT have been close friends, and Source shared his room with SUBJECT until approximately three weeks ago when SUBJECT left the hotel with some friends, and Source had not seen HIM since.

SUBJECT told Source that HE was originally from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, where HE lived with HIS mother, Mrs. Trinkala, prior to coming to New York City. Source had never met Mrs. Trinkala, however, Source had talked with her telephonically on several occasions.

SUBJECT'S parents have been either separated or divorced for several years, further details unknown. To Source's knowledge, SUBJECT has several other brothers and sisters, names unknown. During July or August 1969, SUBJECT was inducted into the United States Army and was assigned to Fort Gordon, Georgia, for basic military training. SUBJECT always discussed with Source the fact that HE was a very religious individual and HE considered HIMSELF a Conscientious Objector. During one of Source's telephone conversations with SUBJECT'S mother, Mrs. Trinkala told Source that she was making the necessary arrangements with her Senator in Pittsburg, name unknown, to get SUBJECT out of military service. At this time, Source told SUBJECT'S mother that he felt it would be difficult to get SUBJECT out of military service; however, Source felt that he could help her and SUBJECT in obtaining SUBJECT'S transfer to the United States Army Chaplain School, (USACS), Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, New York. In December 1969, a couple of days after Source's conversation with SUBJECT'S mother, Source met Nagell at the Strand Hotel. Since Source knew Nagell to be a former United States Army Captain, Source told Nagell about SUBJECT and requested advice from Nagell as to what could be done to have SUBJECT.

1.  NAME OF SUBJECT OR TITLE OF INCIDENT:
    TRINKALA, Victor L.
    DPOB: 28 November 1950; Rochester, Pa.

transferred to USACS. At this time, SUBJECT was at Oakland Army Terminal with PCS orders for Vietnam. Nagell immediately sent a telegram addressed to the Commanding General, Sixth United States Army, requesting SUBJECT'S transfer to USACS since SUBJECT was a Conscientious Objector. Nagell had never met SUBJECT personally; however, the same night that Nagell sent the telegram to Sixth Army in regard to SUBJECT, Source talked to SUBJECT by telephone and at that time Nagell was introduced to SUBJECT telephonically. Source believed that neither Nagell nor Source was instrumental in getting SUBJECT separated from the service, since it is a fact that SUBJECT'S mother mentioned to Source that she was making the necessary arrangements through her Senator in Pittsburg to get SUBJECT separated from the military service. It is Source's opinion, that either Mrs. Trinkala or her Senator was instrumental in getting SUBJECT out of the military. Source knew of no other efforts or attempts made by either Source or Nagell to get SUBJECT separated from the military service. Source could not offer any further information concerning Nagell and had not seen him since that night that Nagell wrote the telegram in behalf of SUBJECT.

In December 1969, SUBJECT was discharged from the United States Army, reason unknown to Source. SUBJECT returned to New York City and continued to share Source's apartment at the Woodstock Hotel. At that time, Source recalled that he was illegally convicted and confined to the FP for the use, possession and selling of narcotics. Since SUBJECT is a young man and there is a narcotics problem in the New York City area, Source started counselling SUBJECT against the use of narcotics or drugs. Source secured a job for SUBJECT at the Clinton Hotel, 19 West 31st Street, New York, New York, where SUBJECT started working during the day shift. Since SUBJECT was working during the day, Source suggested to SUBJECT that HE register at the evening classes offered at the YMCA so that I could finish HIS high school education. To Source's knowledge, SUBJECT never completed high school and Source was unable to state whether or not SUBJECT ever registered in the evening classes offered at the YMCA. Approximately three weeks ago, SUBJECT was at Source's room at the Woodstock Hotel with some friends, not further identified. SUBJECT left the Woodstock Hotel with HIS friends and Source had not seen HIM since then. To Source's knowledge, SUBJECT had never been approached or been in contact with anyone representing policies inimical to the best interests of the United States and it is Source's opinion that SUBJECT would report to the proper United States authorities if HE were ever approached by such a person. SUBJECT was considered to be loyal to the United States and to favor and support the Constitution of this country. SUBJECT is willing to defend the United States against all enemies;

    TRINKALA, Victor L.

however, since HE is a Conscientious Objector, SUBJECT would hesitate to kill anyone other than in self-defense.

Harfez Muneer recommended that Victor L. TRINKALA be favorably considered for assignment to a position of trust and responsibility with the United States Army.

AGENT'S NOTES: During the course of this interview, it was noted by the undersigned that Source appeared to be genuinely interested in the well being of SUBJECT and on several occasions Source made it clear that he wanted to help HIM. Source appeared to be truthful and always answered the questions asked in a straightforward manner and without hesitation. It was also noted that the hotel room occupied by Source at the Woodstock Hotel contained only one bed, which gave reason to believe that SUBJECT and Source were sleeping in one bed while sharing the room at the hotel. When Source was queried concerning SUBJECT, Source presented for inspection a copy of SUBJECT'S Sworn Statement completed by HIM on 19 February 1970 and signed by HIM on 20 February 1970.
