d. Rafael SANTANA Alvares DPOB - 7 November 1932, Las Villas. Subject was a chauffeur (taxi-driver) and plans to be at 7750 Normandy Drive, Apt. 2, Miami, Florida, while in PUPRIME. He stated that he resided at Bermasa No. 210, Havana, Cuba. Though he was not a member of any clandestine group, he assisted the MRR group in Caibarien and just recently assisted others to leave the country. Subject and the aforementioned persons departed Cuba on board the Cuban BLANCA ESTRELLA owned by INRA but operated by Subject's brother Israel SANTANA Alvares, who dropped them at Anguila and returned to Cuba to bring others out that were supposed to meet them, but they missed their connections. Subject's group departed from Isabela de Sagua, Las Villas 24 January 1962 at approximately 2400 hours.

On 22 December 1961 a group of approximately twenty militiamen and men from the ORI were drinking in various bars and displaying the Communist flag. Anyone who appeared to be unsympathetic was beaten. They also went to the homes of some who were suspected of being anti-Castroites and would beat them also. They beat up approximately twenty persons. This took place in Caibarien, Las Villas. Subject was one of many arrested between 22 and 26 December. When they were taken to a restaurant across from the C-2 office, Subject managed to escape. The other three men that came with him on the boat managed to hide him until they made good their escape by boat. Subject lists the following as G-2 agents:

*   Antonio OBREGON Correa, Mayor of Caibarien, Las Villas
*   One TOYO (nickname) is the head of the C-2 in Caibarien
*   (fnu) VILJASON is the assistant to TOYO
*   Evaristo HERRERA, who also works on a boat transhipping sugar from Cayo Frances to Caibarien, Las Villas
*   Roberto Rojos aka ESPONJO
*   Luciano BETAJA, Juanito BETAJA and four other brothers
*   Guillermo SANTANA, Andres SANTANA, Lorenzo SANTANA

Subject further stated that Pedro MONTERO, Alejo MONTERO and Eduardo MONTERO are active members of the MRR group in Caibarien, Las Villas. Francisco ROBLE is the active coordinator for the MRR in this area. Andres and Guillermo GONZALEZ (fishermen) are informers for the C-2 in Caibarien. They will propose that they help Cubans get out of the country. When all preparations are set up, the fishermen inform on those wanting to leave. The same applies to Jose (Pepe) MIRO, Evelio GARCIA and Lado COMA, all of Caibarien, Las Villas. Subject also stated that the 381st and 382nd Battalion of militia are presently in Caibarien, Las Villas. Subject states he is willing to return to Cuba and work for the underground. (Source Comment: If this subject is to be used in any manner, please be reminded that he claims to have escaped from the C-2. He may be trying to infiltrate the groups here or he may be trying to find out how the DRE operates in the Las Villas zone.)
