AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 17

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 8

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

Thank you for calling me about a position as your deputy on the staff of the Select Committee on Assassinations. I anticipate that I will find the Committee's work interesting and challenging.

I have prepared and enclosed a resume for your consideration. I believe that you will find that I am well qualified for the position by virtue of my background and experience.

I look forward to meeting you personally to further discuss the position and work of the Committee.

Very truly yours,

Stephen J. Fallis
