2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

10 May 1960

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Payment to Edward G. Tichborn (P)

1. On 9 May this office received a telegram (in the file) from Tichborn (P) dated 5 May 1960 in which he stated that he had not yet received his check for $650.00 from Ashmead, Hanniford & Associates.

2. The undersigned contacted Mr. Thomas Strange, Cover Division, to find out the reason for this delay. After following up this request he informed me that said check had cleared Tichborn's (P) California bank on 27 April, the Federal Reserve on 29 April and is now in Cover Division as a cancelled check.

3. I tried to phone Tichborn (P) late Monday afternoon (9 May) but he was not in his office. I reached him this morning and advised him that the money had been deposited in his bank on the date noted above. Tichborn (P) said he had not checked with the bank but would do so.
