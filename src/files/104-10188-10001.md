1. as requested in reference, Station Fort au Prince is

pouching to headquarters all of the Lab/ilent cards currently

on file st the station. Please return to tion copies of those

cards containing sufficient information to be of value to tation.

2. Station is in treement with couarters that a hard

copy of the tapes should be sent directly from Station Mexico

City to headquarters in order that head quarters may expedite the

processing of the material. However, tation suggests that in order

to reduce the overall processing time and eliminate what could be

duplication of effort, only Headquarters receive a copy of the

tapes. Then headquarters, when processing the original tapes,

could retape those Creole portions and send a composite tape to the

station for translation.

3. Station currently has a backlog of the LINUS/LIFET

tapes. Please cavise whether these tapes also should be sent to

headquarters for processing.

4. Headquarters comment:

This conversation is about "The Comedians", a book written

about Haiti by Graham Greene. Gerard and Susie are talking to

Pierre Lelong. Pierre says the book was the novel of the month

of February in the U.S. Book is about Duvalier. Gerard has heard

that foreigners are making money on Haition headu by writing such

stories but he has also heard that Greene was in contact with a

person who really gave him full information. Pierre says there

was a review of the book, in L'Edition and he has saved it. Gerard

Pierre if he has the latest edition of the newspaper Combatant,

Pierre has it and promises to return it.

29 GP 85 3.0

Suzie colls Gerard PIERRE CHARLES. Roger hus left Susie a

note. Gerard failed to go where he had planned. Gerard called

Dorce but Dorce wasn't there. He went to the Embassy for 15-20

minutes but he couldn't find him. (Conversation probably about

Aldi Castor's visa.) Gerard asks how everything come out. The

wife of the whief of Police cume over to fix the thing about the

little girl. The police never suspected anybody and they don't

think anybody like that had it. Suzie says Claudette finally found

her passport. Claudette went to a (convent?) and someone stole her

handbag which contained her passport, money and license to work.

Everything was returned the next day with a check for $500. Claudette

had to return the $500.

29 GP 85 9.0

Suzie with Gerard. Suzie asks Gerard if he saw a number on the

front or back of something (papers)? No. There is nothing written

by hand. Gerard received three copies and they are looking for two

more.

29 GP 98 17.5

Suzie calls Gerard. Suzie asks Gerard if Aldi has come by.

Suzie says she is going back to the "mbassy. Gerard has changed every-

thing and the man will come by around 2:00 to pick him up. Judy called

to ask when she should come.

29 GP 103 4.2

Pierre Lelong calling Susie Pierre-Charles. Suzie asks Fierre

when he returned. He just arrived, but without his mother. Suzie

asks Fierre how Lillian and her friends were. They were fine.

Tonton CINEAS had been arrested and had been shot. Also, something

is supposed to start in Haiti. Tonton Cl. AS was in touch with some-

one named Maitre "domond Plin. Clemerd CHARLES was also involved

in the affair. $2,000 was involved. The prзon that gave him the

news was a friend of Clemord CHARU.S. A newspaper in N.Y. numed

11 Tiempo has written about an invasion of Haiti. 11 Tiempo re-

ported that someone named Vixame was involved. Pierre was in a store

in San Juan, Puerto Rico buying some cloth when & Cuban girl

approached him and asked him if he was Haition. The girl was afcompanied

by a Cuban man and they asked Fierre questions about Haitian history.

They asked Pierre if he knew anything about Duvalier. Pierre ex-

plained he was opposed to Puvilier. The Cubans said there were people

in San Juan planning to "catch" Duvelier. Pierre implies that the

Cuban man lives in Mexico. Gerard PILE CHARLES takes the phone.

Gerard tells Pierre that someone named Silvie is on the border. Gerard

asks Pierre if he has brought the merchandise. Yes. Pierre went to the

post office to pick up a pickuge and they were going to open the package

to inspect it but Fierre told the clerk it was not necessary to in-

spect it. The post office clerk said the declared value was too high,

and he had to open it. when he opened it he found it was a hund-

written manuscript so the clerk asked no more questions. Everything

went alright. Fierre mentions that during his trip overseas (Son Juan)

he met Gerard LATESTUE, Gerard asks Pierre what LATORTUE's financial

status was. Pierre thinks LATORTUL is working at the University of

Mayaguez. Pierre says there are a lot of Hoitions in Puerto Rico that

are interested in doing something (Egainst Puvalier?) but most are

without families. They are petty bourgeois or engineers working in

San Juan. The bourgeois Hitions now have stores in Puerto Rico.-

Gerard asks Pierre if LATORTUE mentioned anything about his uncle

Francois LATORTUE. No, he did not. LATORTUE might come to Mexico soon

on a tourist viss. He has to go through some routine to get the visa.

Gerard tells Pierre that Francois LATORTUE is up to his neck in

politics in Haiti. LATORTUE said that the leftist party was really

mistreating MANIGHT and LATORTUL didn't like it. Everytime MANIGAT

opens his mouth somethin; happens. The leftist perties likened MALIGAT

to Castro. Like Castro, MANIGAT talked too much and did too many things.

MANIGAT showed his card too much and that is why they are mistreating

him. It was the Communist party that put MANIGAT where he is, just

as the CP put Castro where he is. LATORTUE has written en articlo to

counter what has happened to MANIGAT. Gerard says he knew MANIGAT 10

years ago in Haiti. LATORTUE has written an article condemning

American intentions of lunding in Haiti. LATORTUE x is Professor of

Economics at the iniversity of Mayaguez. LATORTUE is trying to leave

Puerto Rico and go somewhere else where he can find better work.

the family saying that the economic situation is very rough. Vincent

Gerard is talking to an uidentified person. Gerard explains to

the person that before he travels "they" will give him a test which

will show if he has TB or not. If the test is positive, they will

Five him medecine to stop or cure it. The unidentified person is a-

fraid and Gerard tries to tell him that it is not serious because if

it were, "they" would have given him special treatment in the "zero".
