1. NOVO Sampol, Guillermo. There is no information
available on him beyond that provided this Agency by the
FBI. There is no current or previous operational interest
in this individual.

2. NOVO Sampol, Ignacio. There is no information
available on him beyond that provided this Agency by the
FBI. There is no current or previous operational interest
in this individual.

3. LUGO Alejandrina, Freddy. There is no information
available on him. There is no current or previous operational
interest in this individual.

4. RICARDO Lozano, Hernan. There is no information
available on him. There is no current or previous oper-
ational interest in this individual.

5. BOSCH Avila, Orlando. This Agency was in contact
with BOSCH in Miami from approximately January to November
1962. He was under consideration as an "external coordinator"
in the Evelio Duque exile group. BOSCH was to assist the
Agency and Duque in formulating operational plans for infil-
tration (into Cuba) teams. BOSCH did obtain safehouses and
procured food supplies for the teams. Available information
does not indicate any Agency contact with BOSCH for this
purpose subsequent to November 1962. Later, on 31 October
and 1 November 1963, a representative of this Agency met in
New York City with BOSCH twice. These two meetings were in
connection with efforts by BOSCH to secure financial backing
for air strikes (mounted from Central America) against Cuba.
BOSCH at this time was the General Coordinator of the in-
surrectional Movement of Recuperation (MIRR).
BOSCH was informed through an intermediary on either 2 or 3
November 1963 that no financial backing would be forthcoming.

There is no available information to indicate any Agency
contact with BOSCH subsequent to 1 November 1963.

6. POSADA Carriles, Luis. POSADA arrived in the U.S.
in February 1961 as a political refugee. Shortly after his
arrival, he joined the 2506 Brigade and received paramilitary
training in Guatemala under Agency auspices in preparation
for the Bay of Pigs invasion. POSADA received at least
rudimentary familiarization training in demolitions, and was
trained in usage of various hand-held weapons, in Guatemala.
From March 1963 until March 1964 POSADA was in the U.S. Army
at Fort Benning, Georgia, finishing up as a Second Lieutenant

--- Page 18 ---

14-00000

SECRET

and serving as Officer of a weapons platoon in a Ranger
battalion. In the latter function, POSADA would very
likely have received demolitions training. In March
1965 POSADA was recruited by the Agency to serve as a
Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida. Information
at that time indicated that he already was reported to be
a "demolitions expert". POSADA also was used as a source
of information on Cuban exile activities. In 1965 POSADA
was involved with Luis SIERRA Lopez who was working with
Roberto ALEJOS Arzu, a Guatemalan who was attempting to
overthrow the Guatemalan Government. POSADA was of interest
to the SITARA/ALEJOS group because of his knowledge of
demolitions and weapons. POSADA reported to the Agency
and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities
of this group (and subsequent other Cuban exile activist
organizations with which he became affiliated). As of
August 1966 he was used solely as an informant on the activities
of the 'Cuban Representation in Exile' (RECE), a Miami-based
exile group. POSADA was formally terminated in July 1967.

In August 1967 he was mentioned in a Havana Radio broadcast
as a liaison man between the Agency and RECE. In August
1967 POSADA moved to Caracas and secured a position with
DIGEPOL, the Venezuelan security service (now known as
DISIP). The Agency's Caracas Station hired POSADA as an
informant on DIGEPOL/DISIP activities, with secondary use
as a source on Cuban exile activities in Venezuela. He
functioned in this capacity until 1974 when a change in
Venezuelan Government administration resulted in the loss
of his job with DISIP. He was formally terminated by Caracas
Station on 30 June 1974; however, occasional contact was
maintained with him at his initiative because of certain
outstanding U.S. Federal Income Tax problems POSADA had
because of his (then) status as a Permanent Resident Alien
of the U.S. In mid-February 1976, POSADA recontacted Caracas
Station to volunteer a report on the whereabouts of Orlando
BOSCH Avila, Frank CASTRO Paz, and on a threat to the life
of Salvador ALLENDE's nephew in Costa Rica. The final con-
tact between the Agency and POSADA occurred on 22 June 1975
when he contacted the Caracas Station to request visa as-
sistance for his wife and himself; the assistance was denied.

7. CARBALLO Diaz, Roberto. CARBALLO received Agency
paramilitary training as a member of the 2506 Brigade in
preparation for the Bay of Pigs invasion. He was captured
at the Bay of Pigs, and subsequently was released by the
Cuban Government. Apart from the 2506 Brigade service, there
is no available information to indicate any subsequent con-
tact between the Agency and CARBALLO.

DISPATCH

FROM: Chief, Latin America Division
Chief of Station, Quito

SUBJECT: NOC Byron W. GUTRADT's Past Contacts with
Bosch and WKSCARLET-3

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES & METHODS INVOLVED

1. We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch,
WKSCARLET-3 and several other Cuban exiles were recently arrested
and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on
6 October. After having read these accounts NOC Byron W. GUTRADT
reported, for the record, that he once knew Bosch and WKSCARLET-3
in the early 1960's. GUTRADT met WKSCARLET-3 in 1964 when both
were enrolled in OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia. GUTRADT at that
time had already terminated his relationship with BKHERALD.

While at OCS GUTRADT was not particularly close to WKSCARLET-3
but WKSCARLET-3 was generally knowledgeable of GUTRADT's back-
ground and past BKHERALD activities. GUTRADT has not seen
WKSCARLET-3 since 1964 after completion of the OCS course and
doubts seriously that WKSCARLET-3 would remember him.

2. GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Miami when GUTRADT was
training Bosch in a BKHERALD-sponsored program. Bosch only knew
GUTRADT in alias. GUTRADT has not seen Bosch since completion
of this training.

3. Given the length of time that has elapsed plus the lack
of closeness to either WKSCARLET-3 or Bosch, GUTRADT and the
Station do not believe that their knowledge of his past BKHERALD
activities presents any security problems today. GUTRADT, of
course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and
was surprised to hear of the bombing of the Cubana airliner.

HIS FIRST REQUEST WITH STATEMENT HE HAD BEEN PROMISED BY
CHOADEN WHEN HE LAST VISITED THE HEADQUARTERS AREA THAT A
BKHERALD REPRESENTATIVE WOULD CONTACT HIM FOLLOWING HIS RETURN
TO CARACAS, AND THAT NO ONE HAD CONTACTED HIM. (FACT OF

HE SHOULD ONLY BE CONTACTED AT HIS OFFICE. IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWING HIS RETURN FROM VISIT, HE CLOSED THE OFFICE AND
DID NOT RESPOND TO ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT HIM.) W-1 ALSO

SWING) AND WAS ASKED THE NATURE OF HIS BUSINESS VISIT. HE
SEEMED TO RESENT THIS INQUIRY AND SAID NEVER MIND, HE WOULD
VISIT THE CONSULATE HIMSELF ON 9 NOVEMBER AND MAKE HIS OWN
APPLICATION. BRADSPIES ASKED IF W-1 WOULD INDICATE A TIME
FOR HIS PROPOSED VISIT AND VOLUNTEERED TO BE AVAILABLE TO
PERSONALLY RECEIVE HIM. THIS SEEMED TO ANNOY W-1 EVEN

ANOTHER WORD.
