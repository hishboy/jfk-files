26 July 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of Training Registrar

THROUGH: TO/ORD

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Contract Management Institute Course

1. I attended the Contract Management Institute on 28 to 31 March 1967. Immediately after that course I submitted extensive comments to Mr. Arthur Leach, DD/S&T coordinator for the course, and I understand that those comments were included in the overall recommendations for future changes.

2. Since three and one-half months have transpired since completion of that course, details such as the names of speakers and subject material are a bit hazy but I will repeat my overall reaction to it for whatever benefit it might afford. The course material was good although it could have been oriented much more toward technical project managers rather than administrative officers, to the ultimate benefit of DD/S&T. Two of the speakers were excellent; however, the third, who also was apparently Director of the Institute was very poor both with respect to his understanding of the material and his presentation. Dr. Kennedy of Notre Dame and the lawyer, whose name I do not recall, were excellent.

3. This was primarily a sales pitch for CPIF contracts. My personal impression was that U.S. Government contracting agencies have just about completed the circle of a great procurement finance. In departing from fixed-price and CPFF contracts to CPIF's with various award arrangements, the contract negotiators were unable to really ever define cost and ended up invariably in giving away additional fees to the contractors for nothing received. Definitive costs were always a function of experienced and sound

SECRET

Subject: Evaluation of Contract Management Institute Course

technical investigation and management of a contract and whenever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates became almost completely unpredictable. NASA and the DoD generally have, therefore, gone from CPIF types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAF type ends up being simply another CPFF but with the contractor having the advantage in the establishment of an award fee and with the Government having no recourse to redetermination. My reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms my own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for a well-managed CPFF-type arrangement.

In this connection, you have been selected by your Division, and authorized by the Clandestine Services Records Committee, to act as Records Officer for your component. Your selection is based on your professional qualifications to carry out an assignment requiring experience, judgment, and a knowledge of the objectives of the Clandestine Services. A copy of this memorandum will be placed in your official personnel folder to record your appointment as Records Officer.

2. You are to act on behalf of your Division or Staff element in authorizing the deatation of material of no value to the Clandestine Services in accordance with criteria established for this purpose.
