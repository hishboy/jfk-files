PROCEEDINGS

Mr. Baron. Mr. Halley, is it true that you are here
testifying today under alias, and that Halley is not actually
your true identity?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Your true identity will be on file with the
review staff of the CIA and available for verification by the
Committee if that becomes necessary?

Mr. Halley. That is my understanding.

Mr. Baron. Let me show you a piece of paper marked
"Statement Regarding Testimony and Alias" and let me ask you
whether this is the statement you signed as we were beginning
here today which indicates your true identity and which I have
witnessed?

Mr. Halley. Yes, that is the correct statement that I
signed today. There is a blank there where we have not filled
in the Senator's name.

Mr. Baron. All right.

For the moment, let us leave that blank and enter it into
the record as is, as Exhibit 1.

(The document referred to
was marked Halley Exhibit
No. 1 for identification.)

TOP SECRET

Mr. Baron. It is your understanding, is it not, that we
have worked out an arrangement with the review staff whereby
the statement will be attached to your transcript as an Exhibit
and in a sanitized form, leaving out either of the two reference
to your true identity which will only be available at this
Agency.

Mr. Halley. That is my understanding.

Mr. Baron. Are you aware that you have the right to counsel
before the Committee?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.

Mr. Baron. Are you appearing here, voluntarily here today
without counsel?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.

Mr. Baron. Are you also aware that at any point you are
entitled to cease answering any questions and consult with
counsel if you wish?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of that.

Mr. Baron. Finally, are you aware that all your Constitu-
tional rights are intact before the Committee here today,
including your Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.

Mr. Baron. I think we should put into the record the
arrangement that we made before we began, and correct me if this
is not your understanding of the arrangement, that we are
testifying here today without placing you under oath because

TOP SECRET

there is no Senator available for that purpose, but both you and
I are contemplating having a Senator swear you in and ask you if
your transcript is true to the best of your knowledge at some
point as soon as possible as it can be arranged after today's
session.

Mr. Halley. Yes. The statement that you have just made
is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior
to this conversation going on the record.

Mr. Baron. Thank you.

Let us begin then with some very broad questions
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
JMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-
quarters. I was Chief of Foreign Intelligence Activities for the
Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from those
duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running
intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those
duties; I did engage in a survey of the possibilities for running
intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations
against Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was
your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

I want to qualify that. Undoubtedly, there were some
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area
that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pigs
Operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until
approximately February of 1962.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the Agency?

Mr. Halley. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the
nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '62?

Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.
I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany. In the
course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in
Soviet operations and East German operations.

Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American
affairs prior to February of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I was responsible
for setting up operational activity in Latin America that
was targetted more explicitly on the Eastern European satellites

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
to some extent on the Soviet Union. This was in a period of time
where the Eastern European satellites were expanding their
presence in Latin America. In my duties in the Eastern European
Division, I was responsible for getting this program going in
Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin
America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.
The accuracy of those dates can be checked from my official
travel records, and so on.

Mr. Baron. During that period of time you were actually
in Latin America helping to set up this program?

Mr. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I
travelled to Latin America during this particular period of
time.

Mr. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the
course of that operation?

Mr. Halley. Not specifically. I think I transitted Cuba
on air stops being routed to various countries. I think I was
at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.

Mr. Baron. Not long enough even to talk to the people at
the Station in Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No, I had no contact at any time with the
Havana Station.

Mr. Baron. Did you pick up, during this period of time,
a general sense of the attitude of Latin American governments
toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
attitude, if you did?

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad
political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was
much more narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European
targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly
specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.

Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of
the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not.

Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?

Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,
it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment,
to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that
particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task
Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of
Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular
point in time.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.
These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into
a permanent assignment. I would have to check the exact dates
from my service records, but after having completed the survey
report, shortly thereafter I was asked to go to Miami to become
permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
the exact date at which that permanent change of station took
place.

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that that was sometime before
the end of May of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes. It was probably before that, but as I
say, there are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to look
at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it
could have been March, it could have been April. But I reserve,
you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical
point in terms of what you are trying to establish.

Mr. Baron. Certainly.

I should say generally at this point, if anything we cover
today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely
helpful to us if you would check your answers against documents
that might be available in the CIA.

Mr. Halley. Yes, all right.

Mr. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check that
one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you
joined the JMWAVE station.

During the period of time before you joined JMWAVE, while
you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other
than William Harvey?

Mr. Halley. In a formal sense, this TDY was conducted on
behalf of the task force commander, who was Mr. Harvey. While
I was in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
matters pertaining to that survey to the team who was then in
charge of the operational activity in Miami. That team was
essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox, who has since died.

Mr. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of JMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. Yes. Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what would
be the equivalent of the JMWAVE Station.

Mr. Baron. Was he the head of JMWAVE until the point when
you replaced him, or until the point you became Chief of the
JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct. He was the head of that
unit until such time as I replaced him.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you
were conducting of any link between Task Force W and the so-called
Special Group in the White House which was part of the National
Security Council structure and used the project name MONGOOSE
for anti-Cuban operations?

Mr. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted
this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence
which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a
survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted against
Cuba. The other members of that particular group were General
Lansdale and Mr. Helms.
This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practical
purposes the task force unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.
I am not familiar, however, with the other terminology that you

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
used, that is Project MONGOOSE, or whatever you said. I do not
know the exact words you used. I am not familiar with that
terminology.

Mr. Baron. During the whole period of your involvement
with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as
such?

Mr. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGOOSE. I do not
recall it as an acronym, cryptonym or anything else that was in
common usage in my conversations.

Also, you have to understand that during that particular
time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of
command. In other words, he had parallel lines, if you will.
There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting
regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he
was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helms.

Mr. Baron. You began your survey just about the time that
Mr. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as DDP?

Mr. Halley. That is right.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship
between the three-man group that you have mentioned and William
Harvey as head of Task Force W? Did that group task Harvey
directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms
and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not include
the DCI?

Mr. Halley. My understanding of it at the time was we were

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this
three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of
that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back
from one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey
it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two
channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task
force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.
Helms who was the DDP.

Mr. Baron. As far as Mr. Harvey was concerned, an assign-
ment or order from Richard Helms was an order to be taken at
face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the
stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been
your operating understanding?

Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.
Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valid
Agency instruction.

Mr. Baron. The DCI at this point was John McCone.

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of the relationship
between this three-man group and John McCone at that point?

Mr. Halley. Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to
Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational
plans and programs. On one occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone
to the White House to give a presentation or sit in while the
presentation was being made.

TOP SECRET

Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET

Mr. Baron. Where was this? What was the forum in which
the presentation was made.

Mr. Halley. This was a meeting with President Kennedy and
other members of the then-Cabinet were present at that particular
meeting.

Mr. Baron. Was that a Cabinet meeting or was it a Special
Group meeting as a sub-unit of the National Security Council?

Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This is
1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was
a meeting of the Cabinet or whether it was a meeting of the
National Security Council, or whether it was a meeting of the
Special Group.

Mr. Baron. That is perfectly understandable. Do you recall
which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?

Mr. Halley. Yes. My recollection of that was that Mr.
McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk was present, Mr. Kennedy, the
Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now
at this particular point. Those are the ones that stick out in
my memory as being present.

Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present?

Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a
portion of the presentation. As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave
the other portion of the presentation.

Mr. Baron. Who at that point replaced William Harvey as
Chief of Task Force W?

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET

Mr. Halley. Right. You know, the chronology of the Chiefs
of our Task Force were that it was Harvey, then FitzGerald,
then Screber, after that, Hart. I served with all four of those
This was a very active period, you know, with precision, I cannot
outline for you today the dates when Harvey left and FitzGerald
took over, you know, when FitzGerald left and Screber took over
and so forth. This is something that I would have to research
to give you the precise dates.

Mr. Baron. What was the substance of this meeting that
they had in which the President was present?

Mr. Halley. This was a general review of activities that
were being conducted against Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Was there any mention of any assassination
effort at that meeting?

Mr. Halley. No, there was not.

Mr. Baron. You were attending at that point in connection
with the survey you conducted?

Mr. Halley. No. I was attending at that point as the
Station Chief from Miami in order to make a contribution to the
issues that were being discussed, to the fact that detailed,
substantive back-up for whatever questions might be put to the
Agency spokesmen. I made reference to that because you asked
me if I knew the relationship between Mr. McCone and this
three-man group. I said no, on a day-to-day basis I did not
know the relationship, but that there were meetings that were

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
attended by me in which Mr. McCone was talking to individuals
like Mr. Kennedy, the Attorney General, who was a member of that
group.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that that group might have gone
by any particular name or designation?

Mr. Halley. No, I am not.

Mr. Baron. You are not familiar with the term Special
Group?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of the term Special Group.
I am aware that the chronology of the 303 Committee, Special
Group, 40 Committee and so forth, but as I mentioned to you
earlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between
whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group
meeting, or what it was.

Mr. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man
group that you referred to, including the Attorney General,
General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship
to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-
man group a kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special
Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from
the National Security Council structure.

Mr. Halley. I do not think I can give you an authoritative
answer to that. I would go back to what I previously told
you. When I entered into this project in February of '62, the
chain of command that I was familiar with was this three-man
TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
group in constant contact with Mr. Harvey. The second chain
of command, paralleling that, was Mr. Harvey reporting to the
DDP and the DDP subsequently reporting through his chain of
command to the Director, and that would be the only way that
I could characterize that with any accuracy.

Mr. Baron. Did those two chains of command continue
as the channels of decision-making and tasking when you were
or during your tenure as Chief of Station at JMWAVE?

Mr. Halley. That relationship changed, and again I do
not have the date at my fingertips at what time that changed.
I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, General
Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the
progress that was being made in the operational program. At
some point after that, this three-man group for all intents
and purposes disappeared. General Lansdale was reassigned;
the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the program were made
at the Special Group level. As an example, we would have to
submit every month the number of operations that we were going
to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be
paramilitary means, and these were approved by the Special
Group. There was an approval procedure for setting those up,
so subsequently the three-man group disappeared and the regular
mechanism of the Special Group came into play.

I am sorry, I cannot give you a precise date for that
change, but I am sure it is in the record and I am sure you even

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
have the date because the Agency has been researching all sorts
of material for you. I feel that you would just have to get
those dates for the record.

Mr. Baron. We can do that.

Would you say that every major operation that you undertook
at JMWAVE would have been approved by the Special Group or at
least they would have been put on notice of the nature of any
major operation that you were planning?

Mr. Halley. Why do you not define for me what you consider
to be a major operation so we do not get into, you know, a
problem? If you feel that you cannot do that.

Mr. Baron. Perhaps we can turn it around and say, could
you characterize the kinds of operations generally that you
would refer to this three-man group initially, in the Special
Group later, for their approval, or at least to put them on
notice, the kinds that you might not refer and instead proceed
unilaterally?

Mr. Halley. Initially, the three-man group was seized
with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be
done against Cuba. As soon as that was more or less agreed
upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, the three-man
group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things
and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,
the Special Group. As procedures became more formalized, we
had to submit a monthly schedule of the kind of operations that

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
would be conducted against Cuba in the paramilitary fields.
In other words, if we were going to run an operation that
was going to be a cache replacement in the Cuban mainland, that
had to be put in, say in our October schedule, that October
schedule had to be submitted to the Washington Headquarters so
they could make it available to the Special Group sometime in
September. So I would regard a cache, say the lowest kind of
operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could move up
from team infiltrations that had to be approved in advance,
resupply missions, paramilitary operations against fixed instal-
lations would all be approved.

Mr. Baron. If there had been any operation with the
assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government
leaders as its objective, would such an operation have been
referred to either the three-man group or later the Special
Group.

Mr. Halley. If such an operation had been proposed from
Miami, it would have had to have gone through that particular
process.

Mr. Baron. Your answer seems to indicate that only
operations that originated at the JMWAVE Station would be
referred up for approval. Is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is the kind of activity that I have
firsthand knowledge of. When I became the Station Chief, I told
you my time at this was essentially February of 1962 through

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
either June or July of '65. That was my stewardship, that was
my involvement in the Cuban operation.

During that particular period of time, my firsthand knowledge
of these events would be, if that kind of operation were to go
forward it would have had to go through this approval mechanism,
it would have had to have been some formal action taken. If it
were something that certainly would for some reason might not
be committed to paper, somebody may have wanted to discuss it
orally from Miami, the chain of command would have been from me
to whomever was the head of the Task Force in Washington, or
later, when the Task Force became reintegrated into the Western
Hemisphere Division, I would have had to talk to the Chief of
the Western Hemisphere Division, who at one time was FitzGerald.

Mr. Baron. But a plan that originated at the CIA above
the level of the Chief of Station at JMWAVE would not necessarily
have been referred to Special Group for approval, is that
correct?

Mr. Halley. I have no firsthand knowledge of that, there-
fore I am trying to restrict myself to those things that I have
personal knowledge of. In other words, that is the kind of
thing that I think you should talk to, you know, those who were
involved directly, because I think you can talk to Mr. Harvey
or Mr. Screber or others who would be able to give you a better
perception of that.

I want to make one point here, that once I went to Miami,

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
I was a regular visitor to Washington, but always for one or
two days at a time when there was always a full agenda of events
to be discussed that related to the Station in Miami. I did not
carry here, I did not engage, you know, in idle conversation with
my associates. Therefore, I was not aware of the firsthand
situation of how they conducted business on a sustained basis
on items that did not immediately impact on Miami.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any personal knowledge of any
operation run out of the JMWAVE Station that could be construed
as an assassination effort?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not.

Mr. Baron. Do you have firsthand knowledge of any operation
run out of Florida with CIA involvement that could be construed
as an assassination effort?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not have any firsthand knowledge.
You also have to put this in a historical perspective. In
other words, from what I have read in the Press since then,
obviously I could put certain things together. You are asking
me in this timeframe, 1962 to 1965, did I have any firsthand
knowledge at that particular time?

Mr. Baron. Exactly.

Mr. Halley. The answer to that is no, I did not.
You also have to put yourself in the historical context of
that particular time. Thousands of refugees were coming out of
Cuba, coming into Miami, Dade County up and down the Florida

TOP SECRET

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
Keys. There was a regular mechanism to screen these people.
Any number of these people had plans or ideas for changing the
situation in Cuba, among those ideas for changing the situation
in Cuba were plans to assassinate any number of people in Cuba.
This was something that was talked about, you could go down to
any coffee house in downtown Miami and Cubans would be talking
that kind of language.

So I do not want to leave you with the impression that the
word assassination never came across my radar screen, but we
are talking about, and my answer was geared to a planned opera-
tion by CIA.

Mr. Baron. Or with CIA involvement of any sort?

Mr. Halley. CIA involvement? I know of no operation that
was a planned operational activity, you know, for the sole
purpose of assassinating, you know, Mr. A, B or Mr. C. This was
the ambiente of the time. People were talking about these
things in the refugee community, these kind of things were
being discussed.

Mr. Baron. Mr. A, B or C could have been Fidel Castro, or
Raul Castro?

Mr. Halley. It could have been anyone. This was the mood
of the Latin American revolutionary where a coup, you know, is
a way of life, where restaurants and coffee houses abound with
conversation about how to run a coup. In the running of a coup,
one of the things that people talk about is how do you control

TOP SECRET

Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
the leadership which then exists at that time.

Mr. Baron. Are you saying that you are not aware of any
operation, which could have had as one of its subsidiary objec-
tives, whether the primary objective or not, the assassination
of Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, or Che Guevara, which was run with
CIA involvement?

Mr. Halley. I would like to phrase that question slightly
differently, because I think, you know, you have several things
tied together. I would like to answer your question this way.

During my tenure in Miami, I did not put forth any proposal
to mount an assassination operation. In other words, there
was no formal plan, I did not put forth any operational proposal
along this line.

Secondly, I am not aware of any assassination plans being
put forth, you know, by Mr. Harvey or by anyone else at that
particular time. That is the way I would prefer to answer that.

Mr. Baron. What kind of problem did you have with the
question as it was asked?

Mr. Halley. Well, you lumped a number of things together.
I am trying to separate these out. In other words, you put in
there a secondary or tertiary consideration.

Mr. Baron. Right, I am interested in that.

Mr. Halley. That is what bothers me, because I did not

that we had, who may have been thinking, may have planned, and

I do not feel under the command and control mechanism that
existed that I could exercise through the Station over such a
situation that I could be held responsible for that. Therefore,
I cannot accept your question on the secondary or tertiary
situation because I have no knowledge of those. You may have
some knowledge and you can confront me with some statement by
some Cuban who said that this was part of his mission. I have
to look at that at the time.

Mr. Baron. We will go over some statements, but in trying
to recover this ground one more time, I think it is important
to distinguish an attempt to pin the responsibility on you,
which I am not trying to do by my questioning

Mr. Halley. That is a complicated question.

Mr. Baron. The attempt to simply undoubtedly, the
attempt to simply bring out your knowledge and any awareness
that you may have had of any kind of operation that had assassina-
