SUBJECT: World Associates, Inc. 30 April 1969
Hugh C. McDonald, President DCS Case 52872
406 Wilshire Boulevard
Suite 203
Santa Monica, Calif. 90401

1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Hugh C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source, informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with his visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is going for the purpose of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not plan a "world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting bankers and government security people in various Latin American countries. He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries. Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries. His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security system to banking institutions.

2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are firmed up.

3. McDonald is willing to go to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9 May and meet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have some specific problems which his system will help solve. He feels otherwise it would be a waste of time.

4. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It was decided that since ORD. (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald previously that Carrick discuss the possible meeting on the Voice Ident System directly with McDonald.

5. McDonald was informed 29 April to expect a call from Carrick; that DCS/LAFO would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.

28 April - Tony Lohmann

Agency says that McDonald will come to D.C. if he has some real and honest problems to discuss. He does not have the time to come to Washington for a general discussion on the subject.

Col. West has conversed on part of TSD and several people are interested in sitting in but the interest is not sufficient to justify bringing McDonald to Washington. Cal West approaches his I & E people and was told that Joe Terek had talked to them some time ago and he had already arranged a meeting.

23 January 1970
Subject: World Associates (Hugh McDonald, Proprietor)

1. On 13 January 1970, at the request of McDonald, I met with him. He went into the same routine about his organization expanding throughout the world in various countries in connection with bank security work. Queried specifically on this security designation, he said that he hoped to work with the Bank of America and Inter-Bank of Rochester, New York, in setting up security so that it would be addressed in foreign countries. In arranging to do this he said that he was planning to put law enforcement officers on the payroll in various countries who would have access to government information and who would, in turn, act in liaison for him with banks that might be honoring such credit cards, or merchants, in various cities in the country. Basically, he said that if a credit card is stolen or fraudulently issued and used, and once his organization is notified through his law enforcement employees, he would notify all the banks, hotels, etc., in the city to be on the alert and not charge anything to such card.

2. The end of the conversation indicated that McDonald was again seeking some assistance from the Agency in setting up his organization. I asked him whether or not he had gotten it off the ground as yet and he said he had not, but that he was planning a trip to Europe sometime in February 1970 during which he hoped to sign up law enforcement officers in different cities to work for him. He anticipates that he will put these people on a monthly retainer. He feels he will have a real intelligence organization going in different countries that will provide economic, political, and other types of information. Obviously, McDonald has not yet made any firm arrangements with the Bank of America or Inter-Bank.

3. I told McDonald that I had previously forwarded information concerning his plans to my headquarters and that the reply I had received was that, inasmuch as his organization had law enforcement affiliations, it would be of no interest to the Agency. McDonald then switched the conversation completely and said that he was merely interested in informing us of the existence of his organization abroad. On this basis, I said that I would be glad to make a record of the conversation.

--- Page 22 ---

4. After meeting with McDonald on two occasions now I have come to the conclusion that he has some grandiose plans but has nothing to back them up.

DATE: 15 May 70

1. John Purfey passed the attached to me on Saturday, 9 May. FYI I would like to comment as follows.

2. (Item 1) It was Herbert White, not Beske, who reported on the new radical group at Pitzer; source Linda Knolles. We doubt that we can obtain much more in response to CI/SO questions. We will try, but with caution, since we are dealing with a young, obvious liberal female. As for Tom Clark, we think he is back at Cornell. Our report to you covered all we know to date.

3. (Item 2) R. D. Beske will try and determine what he can about Dr. and Mrs. Leo Kuper at UCLA. If everything appears favorable and we can clear we may contact. However, they are unknown to us. Ask CI/SO what they can tell us about them. It will help.

4. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) These people unknown to us. Who are they? Where did Purfey get their names? What does he know about them? What does he want us to do about them?

5. (Item 7) As I have reported, I will not personally contact John Cole. The FBI regards him as unsuitable to help them and, based upon their assessment, I will not serve any requirements on him. (Sorry my memo on this had an incomplete sentence.)

6. (Item 8) Answer is "no".

7. (Item 9) I have contacted Reid and reported.

8. (Item 10) Joseph Charles' PHS sent in 14 May.

9. (Item 11) I have told Purfey that Hugh McDonald is an opinionated, egotistical ass who refuses to provide any data to support his statements, thereby making it impossible to assess the information he supplies.

10. (Item 12) Beske says the chance of Baum providing anything is questionable.

SUBJECT: Case 52722 LA 416-70

11. (Item 13) I have finally figured out Purfey's West Pointer. During one of our initial conversations I facetiously remarked, in response to types he was looking for, that what he wanted was a red, white and blue Negro, a graduate of West Point, who is now in the export-import business dealing with Africa.

12. (Item 14) I told Purfey on Saturday that the local OS people are and have been in contact with the LAPD and the Sheriff's Office on militant matters, that the OS people are known as Agency; that OS is reporting whatever they learn and for us to involve ourselves would be confusing and duplicative. If Purfey wants to know what OS is getting, tell him to contact Ralph True in Headquarters/OS. Purfey might want to consider having his requirements levied on OS.

13. (Item 15) Beske reports nothing new, and not likely to be anything soon on the Connover-Clarke affair. Connover has changed jobs and is too busy to do much.

14. (Item 16) Beske reports Gonzales may have something on V.B. but he doubts it. He will check.

15. (Item 17) I told Purfey that I do not want to get involved in any activity that would put us in the position of being accused of investigating militants. We are on thin ice as it is. Therefore, Devanon will not be asked to follow up on "Compton" contacts and we will depend on OS police contacts.
