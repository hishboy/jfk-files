1. A liaison service in Venezuela has informed our representatives in Caracas that Subject was arrested in La Guaira on his arrival from Miami, Florida, and is being held by the Venezuelan authorities. The liaison service told our representatives that Subject was in Venezuela to assassinate an unknown target for $15,000.

2. The Liaison service added that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute Subject and asked whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation or The Immigration and Naturalization Service had any interest in Subject. The liaison service's intentions are to deport Subject to Miami if there is FBI or INS interest. Otherwise they will release Subject on condition he leaves Venezuela.
