Review of Files - Manuel Ray y Rivero

DCD Documents

May 2, 1978

1.  Memo dated 24 Oct 1962 to Chief, Contact Division, from Chief, San Francisco Office

Subject: Suitability of Manuel Ray and Miro Cardona for Important Roles in a Possible New Cuban Government

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO
DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR
RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT
AS SANITIZED

Information received from Robert North, Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and long-time source of exceptional value. North visited in Miami and contacted about 25 former Castro supporters representing a broad political gamut. North got the impression from many of the Cubans that they suspected Ray of being a "possible Communist sleeper". North reluctant to pass along this information, because accusations were very broad.

2.  Information report dated 16 July 1962 and Earlier

Source: Cuban National (Alien File #A-12570921) who asked for an interview on occasion of first contact with CIA. Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership in TURN TO CA branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.S. and maintaining connections with colleagues in that country.

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba. To be done by poison -- "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless, and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job. Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country -- dinner in honor of the occasion should bring together most of the important members of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

3.  Cable dated Oct. 3, 1961 - WA CITE NYOR 4902 Support (Travis) info L/A Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo - Cuban lawyer now living in New York City. Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations in Havana. Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000 -- success measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

4.  Information dated June 4, 1961, Subject: Underground Student Leader Comments on Post-invasion Cuba. Reporting officer talked with ISIDRO BORJA, on the leaders of DRE. Borja says top DRE members in jail or in a friendly embassy in Havana but said new leaders have been selected and will resume sabotage activities shortly. Thought the underground could restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months. However, said outside help needed to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, it was possible to buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials -- they were tainted by corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is estimated to be around 80-85%. Most support is out of fear because the people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

4.  Memo to Acting Chief, Contact Division dtd 20 May 1964

From: Chief, Miami Field Office

Subject: Alleged "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray

Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity build-up for Ray in full swing. Tad Szulc reporting Ray's war movements from Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times.

Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez Menoyo. Thinks Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "war" is little more than an MGM-type New York Times production so far.

2.  Cable to Director

From: MASH

19 September 1960

Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY. Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with no apparent difficulties.

CHIBAS' sources of information:

*   Mason in U. S. government
*   Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives
*   Nino Diaz as Alianza representative
*   Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative.

This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.

3.  Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member. CIA considered him an important political asset. RAUL CHIBAS, Ray's assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to Ray and would check with him.

14. 11/14/60 Cable to Director from MASH.

Ray to surface at press conference scheduled for 11/16/60 in Miami.

15. 11/17/60 Cable to Director from MASH

On 11/15/60, Parlett/Felix Bender met with Ray in complete privacy.

"Unquestionably, the youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humble Ray is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and conviction." Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1950 constitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed at beginning of his regime to be promulgated. State would regulate private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" - each member to have specific responsibilities and feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment.

Parlett believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD. Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is problematical.

16. 11/21/60 Memo for Record

Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on subject of handling MRP, 11/18/60

Consensus was that Ray did not politically represent anything to cheer about. Writer felt MRP opposed to joining FRD and recognized need to control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders. Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It was agreed in meeting with Mr. Barnes that financial and military support for MRP be channelled through FRD.

17. 11/23/60 Contact Report: Meeting with Ray and Chibas in NYC, 11/22/60

Ray says MRP has contacts at Isle of Pines with two garrisons and can expect about 750 men to desert Castro at proper time. CAPTAIN CAPOTA is contact with Ray's group.

Ray's people also in contact with commander of prison where Huber Matos is incarcerated. Matos believes PADILLA, the prison commander, would assist

him in an escape. Ray interested in single operation to get military defectors and free Matos. Wants to effect plan on 11/27/60.

Ray wants assistance from U.S. -- military information and supplies.

18. 11/24/60 Cable to Director from JMASH

Meeting with AMCHIRP-1 on 11/23, revealed he had information that MRP in Havana had capabilities to blow up power plant and TV stations in Havana -- a diversionary tactic planned to coordinate with Isle of Pines operation. Ray expects Isle of Pines operation support about 12/15/60.

Notation about Cable: "Operation Unity" is to create dramatic show which will demonstrate that Manolo Ray is wrong when telling contacts in U.S. that his group is the only one capable of action."

19. 11/24/60 Cable to Director from Havana.

Operation Unity involves MRR, MDI, OA, 30th of November Group and MAR (not MAR of PEPIN RIVERO).

MAR and OA groups to blow electric cables in Regla area. MDC group, at same time, to make assassination attempt on CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ at University of Havana.

20. 11/30/60 Cable to Director from Havana

JULIO ANGEL METRE advised planning to travel to Miami 12/1/60 escorted by Brazilian ambassador to Panama. Accompanied by ambassador's wife. MESTRE will be introduced to Ray and will offer services of MDC to Ray at that time. Mestre says plan is approved by "DR. LUCAS" (JOSE FERNANDEZ BADUE) MDC coordinator in Cuba.

6.  Field Information Report

Subject: Background, Character and Economic Concepts of Manuel Ray Rivero

Date: 16 March 1961

Sources: Dr. Oscar SALAS Marrero (paragraphs 1-11) Knew Ray in Cuba

Dr. Jose ALVAREZ Diaz, former Minister of Finance under Prio (Pg 12)

Dr. Jorge BERUFF, former president of Banco de Desarrollo Economico de Cuba, (pg 13)

Note: Cover note pencilled comment (The content is so biased and mixed with untruth that it would be a disservice to the intelligence community to disseminate it.)

Synopsis of paragraphs 1-11. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray was a Protestant but today is completely atheistic. Said Ray organized the MRC against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC and 26th of July Movement fused into one, and as soon as Castro came into power, control of the organization was given to the Communists. Tells of Ray's association with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel was due to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations. Says in Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own movement.

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining relations with USSR and not making Communist Party illegal. Said that although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press coverage, [Alvarez] thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and would try to put ideas into practice if he ever came to power. [Alvarez] also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services, socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruff said Ray well-intentioned with no Communist tendencies. Cited a meeting at which the basic points of the MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement with the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the meeting and Ray argued his case as a simple member of the group. Out of this meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of the banks and public utilities.

On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in paragraph 12 were not true and part of a "campaign against him by Mr. Pawley of the Miami City Transit Company".

Subject: Manolo Ray - Comments on his Anti-Castro Activities

Signed: Calvin Hicks WH/4/PM/Operations

"Ray is believed to have accomplished practically nothing towards the effort to overthrow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so-called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or claimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has always tended to try to take over other groups, rather than cooperate with them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them. His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo RAY is so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous (or more so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to be the power in Cuba."

Tracy Barnes agrees with Noel that no money should be given Ray until his plans are studies. Ray is asking for support separate from FRD since Ray has withdrawn from this group. Noel further states in Memo, "I would like to point out the security risks inherent in any arrangements with REA BENTANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. These fellows have had easy access to the White House and to the Department, are notorious for their 'planned leaks', will probably presume all the Department officials they deal with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it the whole exile community will be well aware that we are providing financial and material support to the RAY group."

Source said MRP leaders in exile believe Ray's dismissal due to propaganda and pressures by the CIA which brought about the impression that the obstacle to receipt of help from outside (money, arms, etc) was Ray himself and that once Ray removed, they would receive all types of help. The exile leaders are of opinion that it was also brought about because Ray was a divisionist inasmuch as he had abandoned Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Council.

MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amalio Fiallo Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera. All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica. The name of MRP was suggested by Raul Chibas and in itself it does not constitute a party or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the following:

a.  The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b.  Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo

c.  Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet

d.  30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e.  Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

f.  Dr. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged to Accion Democratica.

Father Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whether Ray is Communist or Marxist. Lacks quality of leadership because he does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic ideology. He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitious for himself, with great desire for power.
