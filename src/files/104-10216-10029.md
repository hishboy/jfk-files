FIELD NO.

An official Canadian service from officials in Havana.

1. In late April 1968 there was a successful prison break at the El Principe Prison in Havana. A group of prisoners escaped by digging a tunnel to the courtyard of a neighboring hospital. After the escape, ex-Major Rolando Cubela Secades, who was convicted in March 1966 for plotting to assassinate Fidel Castro, was transferred from El Principe to a prison in Oriente Province.

2. It was rumored that Huber Matos, imprisoned since October 1959, was one of the escapees. However, according to the wife of a prisoner in La Cabana Prison in Havana, Matos and 20 other political prisoners were still in Gallery 23 of that prison. Although none of them wore prison uniforms, it is said that the authorities stopped being severe with them on this count.

3. Field Dissem: None.
