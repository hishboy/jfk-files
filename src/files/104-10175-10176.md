2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

19 AUG 1964

TO: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich

FROM: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Lyle STUART

Reference is made to your memorandum dated 1 June 1964, in which you provided this office with several questions you wished to have passed to Miss Viola June COBB regarding Lyle STUART. There follows the information provided by LICOOKY-1 in answer to your inquiry:

1. Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose AREVALO, and *Antikomunismo en America Latina*:

Early in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Arévalo told me that Stuart was prodding him about getting another of his books translated, to take advantage of the publicity around *The Shark and the Sardines*. I was already far beyond speaking terms with Stuart and therefore declined to have anything further to do with him. About three months later, Arévalo told me that Stuart was going to publish *Antikomunismo en America Latina* and that a young American student, married to a Mexican, Angela Delli Sante Arrocha (who had written *Arevalo, Pensador Contemporaneo*, published by Costa Amic, 1952, financed by Als Radical Revolucionario de El Salvador) was doing the translation into English. Early in 1963, Arévalo told me that the translation hadn't been satisfactory and therefore Stuart had obtained a re-translation, by Charleton Beals.

When Stuart was here in Mexico in June, he told Dr. Osegueda that he was very happy about the way the book was selling.

Inasmuch as Stuart has paid Arévalo only 10 percent of moneys received by Stuart on *The Shark and the Sardines* sales (in contrast with some book contracts in which the author receives 10 percent of the money represented by number of copies sold multiplied by the retail sales price) I would assume he is no more generous with *Antikomunismo*. I can ask Dr. Osegueda the exact terms, but I haven't been able to see Osegueda this week.

I know of no affiliations of Stuart with foreign political parties of government. His attempts to get close to Fidel Castro in 1960 were motivated by a desire to exploit the journalistic advantages of an interview. His original interest in *The Shark and the Sardines* was apparently motivated by money-making interests and by the hope that he might spark a sensation - exactly what he did manage to do with his outrageous advertising. He seemed to calculate that there might be libel suits possible against the firms and the newspapers he could provoke to attack him.

The original contract of Arévalo with Stuart was superseded by another in November of 1961, granting Stuart certain rights with regard to other foreign language editions of *The Shark and the Sardines* and, I believe, establishing that Stuart should have first option on other Arévalo books translated into English.

Information about Stuart's dealings with Arévalo and whatever others, could be obtained (with guile) from Eileen Brant, who was his editor at the time of the first contact with Arévalo. She subsequently broke with him because of deep and bitter resentment against him, then returned not too long ago to collaborate with him. She is his wife's sister. She is certainly working with him now only because he finally offered her a little better pay. For her to have changed her mind about him would be almost impossible, I believe, in view of the long history of incidents that had brought her to have contempt for him, at the time I knew her in 1961. She knows his operation inside-out. In order to get information from her, it would be absolutely necessary to approach her from some angle that would give no hint of government investigation. She is very gregarious. She is a fortyish medium-attractive, lonely, New York single woman (unless her status has changed since I knew her). If contacted by somebody she would assume to be a writer, and who would be a bit friendly with her and see her off-hours, she would probably talk freely about Stuart. But she is quite clever and rather worldly in some respects, so that must be kept in mind in case she is contacted. SHE HAS A VERY DEEP AND LONGTIME NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATION. She was active in liberal activities in Chicago, and if I remember correctly, although she is certainly not communist, she considered herself a little jeopardized by the McCarthy period.

Angela Delli Sante-Arroche could also be contacted, of course. I will look for her address at Costa Amic's office and pass it along.

2. Regarding Lyle Stuart, Dr. Raul Osegueda, Bartolome Costa Amic, and Mario Monteforte Toledo:

Dr. Osegueda apparently has had a secret longing to get something of his own printed in English. He seized upon the opportunity of commenting Beals' introduction to *Antikomunismo* in order to write to Stuart this spring. Stuart wrote very cordially back to Osegueda, hoping to meet him on a trip to Mexico in June. When Osegueda confessed to me his correspondence with Stuart, he sought to make me see it as an attempt to speak with Stuart about the royalties Stuart has never paid me.

When Dr. Osegueda finally did see Stuart here in Mexico during the book congress in June, he only very timidly and very, very briefly touched upon the royalty problem, and indeed went to a great deal of trouble to serve Stuart by introducing him to Costa Amic and to Mario Monteforte Toledo. (Stuart had expressed interest in getting in touch with some publishers and writers.) Osegueda bustled about, taking Osegueda and Monteforte Toledo to lunch with Stuart, even managed to get the Monteforte Toledos to invite Stuart to dinner at their apartment. There were tentative discussions of collaborating in the distribution of Costa Amic books in the United States and of publishing some book of Monteforte Toledo's.

However, both Costa Amic and the Monteforte Toledos told me that they found Stuart offensively vulgar and were not at all enthusiastic about having anything to do with him.

Two weeks ago, Osegueda sketched the outline of a book (contemporary history of U.S. and Latin American relations) he hopes Stuart will want to publish, and sent the outline up to him.

"ANTIKOMUNISMO EN AMERICA LATINA"

I am sure you have it on file, but I will enclose a copy of Arévalo's original contract with Stuart.

FROM: CHIEF, CI/OA

SUBJECT: LICCOKY/1

IN ORDER THAT FURTHER CONSIDERATION MAY BE GIVEN YOUR REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN THIS CASE, IT IS REQUESTED THAT YOU FURNISH THIS OFFICE THE INFORMATION CHECKED BELOW. OR REVIEW INFORMATION AS INDICATED.

I have discussed with Paul Burke, DC/CI/ICG, Mexico's request for amendment of OA to use LICOCKY-1 against the Soviet official. He both are of the opinion that she can be used for development of the target to determine his susceptibility to recruitment, but that she should not be used to make the actual recruitment should the matter develop to that point, due to these considerations: (1) She is not a recruiter, never has made a recruitment. (2) Odds are she would be blown to the Soviets, since we must consider that the odds for successful recruitment of a Soviet official are not favorable. (3) Her relationship with LINLUCK in Mexico is fairly well known, so that there could be an unfavorable blow back on LINLUCK.

In authorizing her use in the developmental role, Burke would like for Station to be informed that it should tell LINLUCK that Station's continuing investigation of LICCO-1 discloses her association with Soviets; therefore, he should be very careful in his relationship with her.
