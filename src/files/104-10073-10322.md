Forwarded under separate cover is a list of GSFEW/1's personnel in Libya (Idens A through M) and the areas to which they are assigned. Also forwarded under separate cover, but to Headquarters only, are biographic sketches on ten of the thirteen men employed by GSPEW/1 as02, as well as a profile of himself. It is hoped that basic biographic data on the other three men, Idens F, G and J, can be obtained from LNCUFF Tripoli and Benghazi Consular files. It will be noted that Iden C was born in West Germany.

2. In recent weeks GSFEW/1 has employed Iden N as his secretary and she and her husband (Iden 0) live in the apartment above that of GSFEW/1. Iden N's main duties are to handle GSFEW/1's correspondence and greet any visitors that appear at his apartment door. As previously stated, GSFEW/1's office is located in his apartment and, since he has no telephone, anyone must call on him personally.

3. GSFEW/1 gives high technical capability marks to Idens A, D and I and that Iden E is also a highly qualified man. However, Iden E has caused GSFEW/1 a few headaches with Libyan Customs since Iden E has been the recipient of considerable pornographic literature sent to him through the international mail from Copenhagen. Libyan customs officials have opened the mail, and although possibly secretly interested in the highly graphic material, have told GSFEW/1 that he must take action to guarantee

that no further literature of this nature will come to Libya and to Iden E.

4. Again for Headquarters only is a sketch GSFEW/1 gave the Station on 23 September 1970 which shows the proposed UHF radio system expansion which was the subject of Reference C. Portions circled with red pencil are the planned expansions.

5. Regarding a SRAC system for GSFEW/1's use in Tripoli. Per Station's request that approval be given to lease another apartment in his building would certainly enable him to transmit from his own to the safe apartment. He could be provided with an appropriate radio (he already possesses two tape recorders) for this purpose. GSFEW/1 does not have a radio in his car but could have one installed and arrangements made for him to transmit to NEUWIRTH's residence. The latter is located a half block from a main thoroughfare that GSFEW/1 could frequently and naturally use to get him to various locations in Tripoli. NEUWIRTH's residence is also about a block and a half from Iden P where GSFEW/1 makes a habit of stopping each Friday evening during the "happy hour." He drives to the Iden P, as do other WOCORKERs, and after parking his car could transmit before entering the Iden P. GSFEW/1 also has a TV set, in the event this could be modified as a SRAC device, but it must be taken into consideration that the Libyan programs are only presented during evening hours. The Station also has another safehouse apartment in the Iden Q building which is also located on a busy thoroughfare and a street GSFEW/1 would also have need to take in handling business and shopping affairs. NEUWIRTH has been planning to have a radio placed in this apartment for use during meetings with Station assets.

6. Although GSFEW/1 would often use SRAC only for transmitting purposes, and it would not be necessary to query him on the information he reported, two-way voice communications would probably be essential in those instances where he had technical and other fairly complicated data to relay which would necessitate his case officer being able to make certain it is understood and does not require clarification and/or amplification.

7. Other information concerning the GSFEW/1 activity will follow by separate dispatch.
