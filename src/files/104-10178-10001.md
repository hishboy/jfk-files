EL SEROR POSADA director
de una compania de investi-
gaciones, muestra a MOMEN-
TO los pequenos microfonos
utilizados para espionaje y con-
traespionaje.

Otra de las facetas de
la investigación y segu-
ridad, es el espionaje y
contraespionaje de em-
presas y companias, o
bien para instalar siste-
mas internos o para lle-
varle los secretos a la
competencia.

escapar! _mas probable es
que le vaya peor que antes.
No provoque a los secuestra-
dores pues es un riesgo in-
necesario que se corre con
personas desconocidas. ¡Y no
les subestime! Recuerde que
pueden ser tan inteligentes

No es nada nuevo hoy en
dia que una compania
pueda estar vigilada to-
talmente. Desde el control de
sus hilos telefonicos, hasta
microfonos escondidos en las
salas de conferencias, o en
las oficinas de sus principales
ejecutivos: tampoco es raro
que un señor tome fotos alli
mismo con una camara escon-
dida en un maletin, o que a
esa empresa le graben con-
versaciones desde una distan-
cia de 25 metros. Tal es el ca-
so del espionaje industrial y
contraespionaje industrial. In-
vestigadores privados intervie-
nen, infiltran gente dentro de
una compania, con el fin de
obtener datos secretos y ile-
varselos a la competencia, o
puede ser tambien que los in-
vestigadores penetren a su
propia como para
cir que salgan datos se insta-
la entonces un sistema de se-
guridad interno.

Y cuando nos referimos a
estos hechos no estamos ha-
blando de paises capitalistas
foraneos de gran desarrollo
industrial, sino a esta tierra
tropical y subdesarrollada. En
Venezuela muchisimas com-
panias prestan estos servi-
cios. Una de ellas es la que
dirige el señor Luis Posada
en una empresa que funciona
desde el año 74 "Investiga-
ciones Comerciales e Indus-
triales" (ICI), se basa en la
experiencia de su Director
Gerente, el señor Posada,
quien cuenta con 16 años de-
dicados a estas actividades
de investigacion, repartidos
en la policia de Norteamerica,
en la DISIP y ahora en funcio-
nes privadas.

Conservando el acento de
su tierra de origen, Cuba, Po-
sada converso con MOMENTO:

-Nosotros no tratamos in-
vestigaciones de adulterio, ni
cosas por el estilo. Nuestra
funcion no es para los aboga-
dos, que son los que se en-
riquecen con ello. La compa-
nia se dedica a las empresas
de seguros, comercios e in-
dustrias. El 90% se enfila a
robos cometidos en las indus-
trias, cuya culpabilidad se
da casi siempre en los pro-
pios empleados de estas em-
presas. También se investigan
homicidios e incendios.
-¿Y qué hacen para casos
de espionaje industrial?
-Tenemos des tipos de
operaciones: Ofensiva y de
fensiva. En las primeras se
trata de contrarrestar el es-
pionaje. En la otra, defensiva,
lo que hacemos es contraata-
car. Pero obviamente es mas
caro defenderse que atacar.
-¿Un sospechoso deshonesto
puede ser fotografiado cuando
hace una entrevista con alguien
de la competencia?
-Puede ser precisado
y neutralizado un directivo
que se fue de la empresa y
se está llevando al perso-
nal. Podemos también hacer
vigilancia a los ejecutivos:
desde las personas con quie-
nes almuerza hasta que ha-
ce por la noche.

Refiere que uno de los más
modernos equipos que tienen
es un detector de mentiras,
a base de un test, que permi-
te con una cinta grabada de
la voz, determinar si el exa-
minado miente o no.

-¿Ha dado resultado este
detector?

-Con el aparato descubri-
mos un desfalco de 200 mil
bolivares habido en una em-
presa, donde grabamos a mas
de 50 empleados.

Nos muestra unos grabado-
res minimos, casi invisibles,
que funcionan con baterias
que duran ocho dias, o utili-
zables también con corriente
directa. Un pequeño equipo
de telefonia intercepta tele-
fonos a solo tres cuadras de
la casa vigilada, sin interven-
ción de la DISIP ni otros cuer-
pos policiales.

-También hacemos "barri-
das"; esto significa que noso-
tros localizamos y neutraliza-
mos microfonos que se ha-
yan instalado previamente,
cuando en un sitio va a ha-
ber una reunión importante.

ESTE MODERNO detector de mentiras, permite saber a tra

1. SUGGEST YOU COUNSEL WKSCARLET-3 THAT IF NEITHER HE NOR HIS
WIFE HAVE ENTERED THE U.S. WITHIN THE PERIOD WHEN THEIR ALIEN
RE-ENTRY PERMITS WERE VALID, AND IF THEY DESIRE TO RETAIN THEIR STATUS
AS PERMANENT-RESIDENT ALIENS (PRA), THEY MUST MAKE APPLICATIONS FOR
RETURNING RESIDENT VISAS WITH THE CARACAS CONSULATE. THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT THE VISAS WILL BE ISSUED, SINCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO
QUOTA NUMBER INVOLVED, THE PROCESSING IS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER
IMMIGRANT VISA, WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICER HAVING THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO
MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY APPLY SOLELY FOR A
TOURIST VISA IN THEIR VENEZUELAN PASSPORT, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR PRA
STATUS, SINCE APPLYING FOR A TOURIST VISA IS PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE
OF ABANDONMENT OF PRA STATUS. IF THEY OBTAIN RETURNING
RESIDENT VISAS, THEY SHOULD BE ADVISED TO OBTAIN NEW RE-ENTRY PERMITS
WHILE IN U.S.

2. NO HQS OBJECTION TO ASSIST WKSCARLET-3 OBTAIN VISAS LOCALLY.
