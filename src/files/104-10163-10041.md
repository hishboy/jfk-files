2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

30 June 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin Ferrer

DATE: 30 June at 1100 hours

1. Upon Erneido Oliva's request, AMBIDDY-1 went to meet with him last night. At the meeting Oliva mentioned to A-1 that he (Oliva) was receiving the backing of KUBARK and the Pentagon and implied A-1 was also receiving aid. Oliva stated that he has met with Alfredo Rodemeyer, the same Rodemeyer that both of them had met early last year. A-1 replied this was all before the death of Kennedy and he no longer had contact with any of ODYOKE's officials.

2. According to Oliva, Mr. Rodemeyer spoke badly of some of the personnel in A-1's organization, e.g., Antonio Iglesias. Oliva mentioned that he had talked with Thomas Mann recently and expected to see Mr. Mann within the coming week to receive support for his conventional warfare program.

3. A-1 told Oliva he had no objection to the conventional warfare plan and that he would morally support Oliva in liberating Cuba. However, he would continue in his own little way with his unconventional war. According to A-1, he made it clear to Oliva that he was not receiving ODYOKE backing.

4. A-1 expects to leave on 1 July for Costa Rica tomorrow. He again mentioned that Adelaide will soon be leaving the United States. A-1 commented he does not expect to visit the United States as often as he has done in the past. A-1 asked that Enrique and Mr. Archer clearly understand that he does intend to keep his word concerning the changes he has mentioned to us at the last two meetings.

Above conversation conducted in prearranged frequently changed privacy code.

SECRET

3. A-1 expressed a desire to meet with Mr. Archer sometime after the August operations.

AMWORLD'S MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 Jun 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY-1's Image and Philosophy

1. AMBIDDY-1's preoccupation with his political image shone thru, when he inquired whether we suspected him of dictatorial leanings. We replied, in effect, that we entertained such suspicions and inclined toward taking his protestations of Liberalism and laissez faire with a heavy dose of salt. Once in power, he would treat the 1940 as a scrap of paper and run the country along authoritarian lines. Flattered at his implied inclusion in the line of succession, A-1 only spoke of wild dissent.

2. Considering the exigencies of autonomy, we have conveyed to him in a variety of ways that we do not particularly care one way or the other about much opportunity, let alone leverage in shaping AMBIDDY-1's political philosophy, that we do not fancy him as a chosen instrument outside the periphery of AMWORLD and that by extension, we have no intention of promoting any political aspirations he may harbor. We have also left no doubt in his mind that we view his performance in the AMWORLD driver's seat rather than any philosophical streams of consciousness, as a dependable gauge of how he would be performing in a position of political responsibility.

3. We pointed out to AMBIDDY-1 that Liberation Day would find a prostrate, bankrupt and exhausted people, wary to death of politics and propaganda, craving to be left alone for a while even with its thoughts. There would be no political infrastructure on which to build and prematurely called general elections would merely serve to debase the currency of parliamentary democracy even more. For a while at least, a benign and just executive would have to restore Cuba's equilibrium and permit her to rebuild the basic institutions without which democracy cannot properly function.

In this context, we mentioned sentiments expressed by AMBIDDY-1 on Venezuela TV deprecating largescale revenge during the reconstruction phase and voiced hope that he would do his share to see these noble ideas put into effect.

29 June 1964
AMWORLD MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT: Adelaida PADRON y Cruz - Decision to Move Her to Nicaragua

1. Drawing liberally upon data supplied in UFGA 16512, we reminded AMBIDDY-1 about our misgivings regarding his association with Adelaida PADRON y Cruz. He conceded awareness of some of the rumors circulating about her past private life and stated that he had satisfied himself that they were unfounded. We injected that we knew that Jose Mole Rosales has been asked to do some investigating and had given Adelaida Padron a clean bill of health. We also happened to know that was aware of the true story and for reasons of his own decided to withhold it from AMBIDDY-1. We inquired what he knew about Senora HOLE and he commented that she had been a "bad woman". We observed that the "had been" sounded to us like a telephone conversation.

2. AMBIDDY-1 averred that he had listened to a telephone conversation between Adelaida and her former husband, Roger Rojas Lavernia, in which the latter had admitted that the story about his having acted under higher orders when marrying Adelaida were unfounded. AMBIDDY-1 also charged the ex-husband of having tried to entice his wife to participate in orgies, that Adelaida had refused to.

3. As regards Adelaida's alleged illicit relationship with ex-President BATISTA, AMBIDDY-1 simply declared the charge unfounded. Adelaide did know Carlos CANTILLO Gonzales as an old friend of the family. She also had met ex-President PEREZ JINEHEZ, but nothing of compromising nature had ensued. When asked whether it is true that Adelaida had introduced him to several prominent Venezuelans, he denied this and stated that introductions had been made by Silvia GARCIA, a trusted childhood friend of AMBIDDY-1.

4. Our query why Adelaida, if she had AMBIDDY-1's interests at heart, appeared to have qualms about owning up in respect to past events, was parried by AMBIDDY-1 by claiming that Adelaida was of course aware of all these rumors and had warned him of possible political embarrassment.

5. Evaluating UFGA 16512 on the basis of our talk with AMBIDDY-1, we conclude that its main source has a high batting average. At least there appears to be a hard core of truth to practically all allegations made, to the extent we were able to check them out. We would venture the guess that, despite his protestations to the contrary, AMBIDDY-1 is quite conversant with Adelaida's past history, but can see no practical gain in so telling us. He may reason that an avowal of intent to marry a woman whose antecedents are in fact as described, would seriously blemish his image and that by pleading ignorance now he can, if things should get out of control, always strike a pose of injured innocence and elicit a "here but for the Grace of God go I" reaction from his PRPRIME associates.

6. Agreement that all interested parties would benefit by moving Adelaida's abode from the WAVE area to Nicaragua was reached on the basis of AMBIDDY-1's acceptance of our flat statement that we view Adelaida as a potential hazard to AMWORLD's and KUBARK's security. We based this reasoning upon numerous indications that Adelaide had become all but completely privy to everything that was going on in AMWORLD and that her discretion left a great deal to be desired. We drew no denial from AMBIDDY-1 stating that Adelaida had become witting of the WAVE training course for AMBIDDY-1 and that she presumably knew about KUBARK support for AMWORLD. We referred to Adelaida's lesbian associates, without stating that we suspected her of holding charter membership in that severity. He mentioned by name Aida PEREZ and Lucia CANO. When the latter was labelled by us a lesbian believed to be in Adelaide's complete confidence, AMBIDDY-1 evinced surprise and for reasons difficult to fathom almost dismay. We concluded by stressing the importance of breaking up Adelaide's circle of associates and confidants as an indispensable prerequisite for containing the threat her access to information we consider classified represents and asked AMBIDDY-1 to make sure that no member of this group would follow her to Nicaragua.

7. We made no attempt, which in any case would have been vain, to break up the relationship between AMBIDDY-1 and Adelaida. We apologized to him for involving ourselves in matters of a private and intimate nature which unfortunately were beginning to impinge upon ODYOKE security interests. AMBIDDY-1 in turn made it clear that he thinks he is in love and that separation is not in the cards. We dropped the issue by assuring AMBIDDY-1 that the day would come when things could be seen in better perspective and that he could depend on us not to gloat or remind him that we had told him so.

8. We mentioned offhand that we assumed that Adelaida had all the papers necessary to effect her departure from PRPRIME. AMBIDDY-1 replied that she had not been able yet to get the necessary papers. We simply commented that she should ask for them.

TYPIC/AMWORLD--Identity

REFS: A. UFGA 16512, 15 June 1964
B. DIR 31528

1. Chief, WH requests that an investigation of the truth of some of the allegations made in Ref A report be held in abeyance pending determination whether Subject in fact has decided to leave PRPRIME for Nicaragua.

2. Headquarters continues to be interested in additional data regarding the house in the WAVE area which AMBIDDY-1 intends to purchase in the name of Nilo Messer.

3. If it should turn out that the conditions described in Ref A report are not drastically remedied and continue to pose a festering threat to the security of AMWORLD, your Station may have to be requested to investigate. In the meanwhile, we are hopeful that Subject's removal from the WAVE area will serve to attenuate this bad situation.

4. Thanks to Ref A report, we were able (without going into too much sordid detail) to put AMBIDUY-1 on notice that we view his association with Subject in the WAVE area as a potential threat to AMWORLD's and KUBARK's security and that the political scandal potential of the existing situation is equally formidable. We consequently fell in with AMBIDDY-1's suggestion, made during the latest meeting in Panama City, that he move the center of his illicit affair to Managua where it would be easier to contain unpleasant repercussions than in the WAVE area. We urged AMBIDDY-1, and he promised to heed our advice, that he not permit subject to take along to Nicaragua members of her present entourage, singling out identity of Ref A as a particular case in point.

5. It should be stressed that AMBIDDY-1 is unwavering in his (real or feigned) conviction that Subject is pure as driven snow and badly maligned and that he has a ready explanation for every "rumor." It would have been unwise to attempt coercing him into discontinuing his affair with Subject and most likely he would not have yielded to any pressures. Hence, we had no choice but to settle for the proposed move to Nicaragua which represents a palliative at best.

Debriefing of Russell H. Sambora in Wash., D.C. 16 June 1964
SUBJECT: DMJM Engineers

1. Bambora reported he met with AMBIDDY/1 at the Miami airport on 5 June 1964 for a brief discussion of organizational changes. After their talk, A/1 requested Sambora accompany him to the airport hotel to act as interpreter with an American engineer (possibly DMJM). Sambora did not recall the name of the engineer but that the engineer had stated the airstrip in Nicaragua would cost somewhere in the vicinity of a million dollars. According to Sambora, A/1 simply listened to the proposal and said he would take the matter under advisement.

AMWORLD Meeting in Miami, 23 June 1964
SUBJECT: Photographs of Adelaida Padron

1. During a lull in the meeting I took AMBIDDY-1 aside (as instructed) and told him it would be best for all concerned to take Adelaida out of PRPRIME as he had suggested. I mentioned to him there is a growing number of reports on Adelaida finding their way to Washington, making it increasingly difficult for us to protect his rear.

2. I then casually mentioned to him that we had received some obscene photographs which have caused us to do some fast talking with "some people in Washington" that are beginning to have some misgivings about AMBIDDY-1 (actually this story is notional).

3. I noticed the remark concerning the photographs upset AMBIDDY-1. "Do you mean immoral pictures, Martin?" AMBIDDY-1 inquired. I nodded and to avoid his asking further questions about the pictures, I reminded him of his promise that Lucia Cano, Natacha d'Angelo (AMBIDDY-1 denied knowing her) and Aida Perez Poso would not follow Adelaida to Nicaragua.

4. During the rest of the meeting AMBIDDY-1 appeared somewhat dejected and preoccupied. It is the opinion of the CO's attending the meeting that this was attributed to the remarks made concerning the existence of these photographs.

5. As the meeting was about to end, AMBIDDY-1 asked "Do you really have some immoral pictures of Adelaida, Martin?" Again I said "Yes." These photographs had come into our possession plus much more information that we had not divulged to him. AMBIDDY-1 then inquired if he could see the photographs. I replied that it was our feeling that it would serve no useful purpose other than to satisfy his own curiosity. Inasmuch as he had promised to take Adelaida out of the country, there was no sense in rubbing salt into the wound. Furthermore, we did not wish to reveal our sources to AMBIDDY-1. Lastly, both he and I know that photographs could be fabricated and we did not want to be falsely accused of doing just this. AMBIDDY-1 again asked that I inform BECKHOFF that he is interested in seeing the pictures. In order to drop the entire subject, I promised AMBIDDY-1 I would pass the message to BECKHOFF.

6. BECKHOFF believes that this (notional) intervention jarred AMBIDDY-1 out of his complacent assumption that we lack substantial information to back up our claim that Adelaida's immoralities are more than unprovable rumors. Also, hopefully, he may now have been put on guard and may take adequate precautions against blackmail of himself or Adelaida which we consider a major threat to the security of AMWORLD. If in future meetings AMBIDDY-1 should revert to the existence of these photographs, it may be best to state that they were promptly destroyed but that their also being in the possession of potential blackmailers can never be ruled out. AMBIDDY-1 should be reminded of his assurance to alert us immediately if such blackmail attempts are made since he may need our help in warding them off. He has our assurance that we would not use the cropping up of such difficulties to remind him of his failure to heed our advice.

AMWORLD Meeting in Miami, 28 June 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY-1's Dream House and Personal Finances

1. Without impugning AMBIDDY-1's right to purchase a home we advised him that many derogatory reports have reached our ears concerning his purchase of a home and for this reason only we wanted to set the record straight and thereby be in a better position to combat malicious rumors. A-1 said he understood and it was evident A-1 did not take it (the inquiry) as a personal affront. During a break in the meeting A-1 went home to obtain the necessary data on the house. Within a few hours A-1 returned with the information plus a blueprint of the house.

2. A-1 stated the only house he owns is the one in which he and Adelaida are now residing. This house is located at 1270 N. E. 85 Street, Miami, Florida. The original downpayment was $6,500. The monthly payment on the house is $230. The funds for the downpayment were obtained from:

a. His own personal bank account ($4,000),
b. Adelaida contributed money she had received from an automobile accident ($1,000).
c. The balance was borrowed from Sixto Mesa ($1,500).

3. A-1 added that the money borrowed from Adelaida and Mesa was paid back to them. According to A-1 the house is valued at $35,000. A-1 was asked why the house was not registered in his name. A-1 replied this was done to prevent rumors from starting as to where he had gotten the money. For this reason the house is registered in the name of Antonio Sans (A-1's bodyguard). When Adelaida departs for Nicaragua, A-1 intends to lease the house to Sans for $130 a month.

4. Without being asked A-1 stated he wanted to clarify his financial situation since his return from prison. A-1 reported he has earned $4,500 from the sale of Marchas de Guerra y Cantos de Presidio; from the sale of the book Bay of Pigs he has so far earned $4,300 in royalties of which $1,000 has been sent to the underground in Cuba. His personal bank account at present totals $1,700. A-1 also maintains he has no other bank account in any other country.

5. We again mentioned to A-1 that our sole purpose was to hear the facts from him to prevent the waggling of idle tongues.

It was mentioned to A-1 that Mr. Barnes has been waiting for over a week to see someone in A-1's organization. Mr. Barnes has been kind enough to offer his services and we feel it is unfair to keep this gentleman waiting. A-1 plans to send Sixto Mesa and Mr. King today.

1. AMBIDDY-1 called the office again to say that he would be meeting Al Burt at 1600. A-1 inquired if it would do any harm in seeing Mr. Summ of the State Department since the latter mentioned to AMJAVA-4 that he had not seen A-1 in over a year. A-1 felt that a courtesy visit was called for. We advised A-1 that we could see no harm in visiting him.

2. A-1 reported that one of his pilots, Ginebra, had received an offer to fly planes in the Congo. A-1 did not know if Ginebra would accept the offer.

3. We told A-1 that we had received a report that in a finca in Nicaragua called Marianita he had met several U. S. Air Force officers and asked if there were any truth to the report. A-1 stated that one of their houses is located in Marianita but he had not met any U. S. officers there.

4. A-1 gleefully reported he contemplates making quite a lot of changes in Miami. A-1 did not elaborate but it appears that most of the propaganda section will be leaving Miami.

5. A-1 was requested to obtain a position report of the DOLORES by 1 June.

6. We asked A-1 if he had any ideas of where AMBANG-1 is at present. A-1 is of the opinion that AMBANG-1 is probably hiding in some small island off Puerto Rico.

7. A-1 inquired if he could sue the Newsweek magazine. We advised him that he could sue but the likelihood of him winning the case was slight. A-1 was referring to the article which stated he intended to draw the United States into an open conflict with Castro. We asked if there were any truth to the matter. A-1 laughed and said, "Of course not."

8. A-1 was advised that we consider 7 June a firm date for the Consejo meeting. The reason we are pinning him down to a specific date was because of the necessary preparations that have to be made prior to any meeting. A-1 said he would be there on that date.

In the special commo training given to Felix, a course was specially geared to choosing the correct frequencies and the proper crystals. A-1 mentioned the original request had stemmed from Felix. A-1 was informed that the reports we have gotten about Felix reflect that he likes to give the tedious jobs to someone else and this is the case here.

3. A-1 and AMJAVA-4 will be leaving for Nicaragua on 5 June.

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin Ferrer

DATE: 30 May 1964 at 1230

1. AMBIDDY-1 stated that AMJAVA-4 will be meeting with Carl in Houston this afternoon.

2. A-1 wants to meet with the Consejo on 7 June at 0830 in Panama City.

3. A-1 again reminded we would like to have the tapes on what transpired in Venezuela. Martin reiterated that in order to protect his interest we must have current intelligence concerning his organization.

4. It is the opinion of the Consejo that a frank, off-the-record talk with Al Burt of the Miami press would do no harm. We consider Burt to be a responsible newspaper man and he may be in a position to help A-1 put the Pilon raid in its proper perspective. If A-1 thinks this is a good idea he should speak openly to Burt about the Pilon raid omitting the embroidery that has accompanied his recent press statements. A-1 was reminded this interview, if given, should not mention or allude to KUBARK support. Since Burt is an ambitious journalist he may probably ask A-1 for a scoop on his next raid; again we see no harm in this. A-1 said he would ask Burt if he wanted to go on a future raid. We mentioned that we doubted he would accept the offer.

5. According to A-1, AMYUM-19 is still in New York and is expected in Miami shortly.

6. A-1 was informed that the ADELAIDA is scheduled to leave drydock on 31 May.

7. A-1 reported he has talked to Miguel Angel Quevedo of Bohemia Libre and representatives of Life magazine concerning the release of pictures to be taken by his own combat photographer. A-1 added, however, he had made no firm commitments.

8. A-1 was asked if his next operation had been given a name yet. He said the next one was to be called "Simon Bolivar." We told him that we already learned the code name and warned him against loose talk and the damages that could ensue.

9. A-1 was asked to contact Manolin Hernandez and inquire why the DC-3 cannot be in Panama before 2 June 1964. A-1 was advised that Petrosky can furnish a crew to pick up the plane if necessary but cannot since he has no contact with anyone in Costa Rica. A-1 stated he would call Hernandez in Costa Rica.

10. A-1 was informed that three men aboard the ADELAIDA have signed off and should be returning to Miami on 29 May 64.

1. AMBIDDY-1 called to say that he had just arrived in the United States and would only be staying a short period and then return to Central America for the next operation phase. He stated he wanted to discuss some matters with "Enrique" in Panama within the coming week. I advised him to let us know exactly when and where and we would be there.

2. A-1 inquired if AMJAVA-4 had requested rubber boats from us at the last meeting A-4 attended in Washington. A-1 was informed that we had discussed the matter but could not recall A-4 placing any order with the Consejo for rafts. A-1 asked if some rafts could be obtained in time for the coming operation. A-1 did not know the exact amount needed but would consult with A-4 and call Martin later in the evening. The rubber rafts could be sent to same address as were the village radios. A-1 mentioned they had the silent motors.

3. A-1 was asked to inquire what had gone wrong in Santo Domingo. A-1 believes that the reason the JOANNE could not be put into drydock was because there was another ship in the military yard undergoing repairs. A-1 was advised that was not the information we had received and could he please check further into the matter. A-1 will have Rafael GARCIA confront President Reid and obtain the true story.

4. A-1 wanted five metascopes for the next operation. Since those aboard the MV. SANTA MARIA will not arrive in time, Dick will get more and give them to Nike GEIDEL who in turn will deliver them to AMYUM-19.

5. According to A-1 Maritima Bam now is officially registered in Nicaragua.

6. A-1 asked Enrique to convey to Mr. Archer his gratitude for the letter Mr. Archer had sent him.

7. A-1 is very pleased concerning the possibilities of extending his operational bases to Venezuela. A-1 was asked to send us a tape of what had transpired and the government officials with whom he had met.

8. The conversation ended with A-1 promising to call later tonight (28 May) as to where he and A-4 wanted to meet with Carl.
