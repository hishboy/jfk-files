DATES: 11 Sept 63

CATEGORIES: DIEM

OCCURRENCE: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamara pointed out that Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented that he believed that we should move cautiously, that we should talk seriously to Diem and that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation in a departure. The President asked whether we had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid (as proposed in a paper prepared by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the President should be well informed of any steps taken in this context such as the instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

DATES: 5 Oct 1963

CATEGORIES: DIEM

OCCURRENCE: On or about October 5, 1963 when the telegram of October 5 and 6 were sent to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reservations concerning DIEM and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all the pressure we could on DIEM to change his ways, to encourage more support throughout the country. My precise words to the President, and I remember them very clearly, was that Mr. President, if I was manager of a baseball team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether he was a good pitcher or not. By that I was saying that, if DIEM was removed we would have not one coup, but we would have a succession of coups and political disorder in Vietnam, and it might last several years as indeed it did. So it was for that reason that I felt there would be more stability if DIEM could be persuaded to change his ways than remove him and hope that some group of generals could run the country better."

OCCURRENCE: On October 5, 1963, MC CONE sent, to some locations, including SAIGON the following message: "Believe assassination discussions most careful handling. In general best line is no line so that it is clear that we are sticking to position of having no responsibility for actions of any of various contending Vietnamese groups. We certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating, approving, or supporting assassination, but on the other hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every such threat of which we might receive even partial knowledge. We certainly would not favor assassination of DIEM. We believe engaging ourselves by taking position on this matter opens door too easily for probes of our position re others, re support of regime, etc. Consequently, believe best approach is hands off. However, we naturally interested in intelligence on any such plan. This message has been cleared with State Department."

He did not want the U.S. government to start the coup d'etat. He also outlined three general ideas, this was the first time that a leader had mentioned the possibility of assassination. This assassination was not of DIEM. This was if they could not do anything, it would be the elimination of NGO DINH CAN, who was the war lord in central Vietnam and NGO DINH NHU. At that time GENERAL MINH did say that one of the alternative means was to eliminate CAN and NHU and keep DIEM." That was one of the alternatives. p. 25

Faced with this information and given strictly limited time factors, RICHARDSON decided that the meeting with GENERALS MINH and KHIEM should not be postponed but that contacting officers would make this meeting a fact-finding mission without encouraging or discouraging GENERAL MINH.

OCCURRENCE: The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following description of the events of August 25, 1963, from a book by MARGUERITE HIGGINS: "The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek tragedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saigon late in the evening of August 24, 1963, a date made more significant because it was a Saturday. Washington usually empties on summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation.

"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON. It was drawn up at a meeting called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task force. The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECTOR JOHN MCCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

OCCURRENCE: SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK was attending a baseball game in New York. PRESIDENT KENNEDY was at Hyannis Port. GENERAL TAYLOR says he knew nothing of the meeting until it was over and the telegram long on its way.

"... the cable proved historic. For the first time it gave the signal to 'unleash' the Vietnamese military, flashed a green light for the coup against DIEM of which the generals had been talking for so many years.

"... the cable of August 24 was a radical revision of the previous philosophy of one war at a time. It envisaged the generals' making war on their own government, and with the implicit blessing of the United States.

"The substance of the cable was that the U.S. EMBASSY was to make an effort (con't.)

OCCURRENCE: so persuade DIEM to fire his brother, release the Buddhist rebels, end press censorship, and restore other democratic liberties suspended under martial law. And if, as the cable anticipated, DIEM would not do these things, then the EMBASSY was to contact the VIETNAMESE GENERALS and tell them that the United States would no longer stand in the way of a revolt.

"... the controversial August 24 cable was dispatched from Washington Saturday evening after being cryptically summarized to PRESIDENT KENNEDY at the summer White House at Hyannis Port.

"The ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ROSWELL GILPATRIC ... had the cable described to him over the telephone. MR. GILPATRIC says he was frankly surprised that such an important set of instructions should be rushed out on a weekend. But he did not feel that he ought to veto the telegram since ... it had the 'approval of the PRESIDENT.'

"In McCONE's absence, the cable was described, again cryptically, to RICHARD HELMS, DEPUTY DIRECTOR of the CIA, who also did not feel disposed to veto something 'approved by the PRESIDENT.'" (5-6)

OCCURRENCE: Higgins states that the Xa Loi pagoda, based on her own experiences, was more a political command post than a holy place. It was the headquarters from which the militant Thich Tri Quang and others had run their political war against the Diem regime.

According to Higgins, Thich Tri Quang told an Austrian journalist by the name of Denis Warner early in August that he hoped in the process "they would kill one or two of us."

Higgins goes on to note that the State Department regarded the actions against a dozen pagodas a betrayal of Diem's promise to reconciliate the Buddhists. (Page 181)

OCCURRENCE: Higgins claims that "...the raids by the Vietnamese Army and the pagodas took place five days after the departure of Ambassador Milting from Saigon, and a week before Henry Cabot Lodge was expected to arrive on his first tour of duty in Viet Nam." Higgins goes on to explain that Diem claimed that the reason that the raids were performed at this time was because: "It had become clear that Thich Tri Quang of Buddhist was that no intention of coming to any agreement with the government, irrespective of how many consessions were made. Since the raids would create an anti-Diem propaganda explosion, it would be less embarrassing to the United States if they took place when the new Ambassador was President of Vietnam. For the same reason, great care was taken not to inform the United States of the pagoda plans. The reasoning was that Washington could not be blamed for something about which I knew nothing."

We do not think the Communists would necessarily profit if he were overthrown by some combination of his non-Communist opponents. A non-Communist successor regime might be initially less effective against the Viet Cong, but, given continued support from the U.

OCCURRENCE: Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view. Higgins does not doubt that the Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti-Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the vatican with the National Vietnamese flag on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number.

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that the catalyst that brought down the DIEM regime was their antagonism of the Buddhists. He explained that 80% of the Vietnamese people claimed to be Buddhists. And that DIEM led a Catholic regime and that this drove people, particularly in light of MADAME NHU's statements to the effect that she'd like to furnish some mustard at a bonzes barbecue, or something to that effect. This made people want to identify themselves against the regime and so they would go back to the pagodas. CONEIN did not know whether or not this became the principal reason for the United States wanting to get rid of the regime. pp. 42-44.

(Ambassador Nolting was on a Meditterranean vaction at the time.)

"According to Mecklin, William Trueheart, the Charge d'Affaires, applied on orders from Washington, 'direct, relentless, tablehammering pressure on Diem such as the United States had seldom before attempted with a sovereign friendly government...' In despair Trueheart in June resorted to a formal warning to Diem that if he continued repressive measures (police effort to prevent and disperse illegal demonstrations), the United States would be forced to disassociate itself publicly from such actions, indeed we did two months later. The warning was a momentous step. It amounted to a direct official command from (continued next card)

If this would have been done, I think that we would have been much better off....This was a turning point of the political situation....". pp. 41-42

MAJOR GEN. TRAN VAN DON

CATEGORIES: DIEM

OCCURRENCE: "Immediately after May 8, President Diem ordered a formal investigation of the Hue affairs. For this purpose he appointed a 3-man technical commission led by Major General Tran Van Don, the acting head of the army (General Don was considered a man of integrity by the Americans.)" The commission also included the Surgeon General of the Vietnamese Army and its Chief of Ordinance. After extensive interrogation of witnesses General Don's mission cited plastic charges as the cause of the deaths on May 8.

"At the time, nonetheless, Diem's regime claimed that plastic bombs caused the deaths was widely ridiculed.

"Unfortunately, no American officials were witness to the incidence. The American consul had been out of town but he tended to disbelieve the government's efforts to place the blame on Viet Cong plastics. He felt that the american supplied grenades were responsible for the killings." (96)
