SUBJ - ARRIVAL IN U.S. OF BRIGADE DEPENDENT FROM CUBA
AND SETTLEMENT OF TRUSTEE ACCOUNT.
ACTION REQUIRED - REQUEST CABLE CONCURRENCE OF JMWAVE'S
PLAN IN PARA 3.
A. MRS. CLARA MOLINA CABRERA ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES FROM CUBA AND CONTACTED AMTIKI-1 BY LETTER DATED 2
JUNE 1968. MRS. MOLINA IS THE MOTHER OF MARIANO SANTOS
MOLINA, KILLED DURING THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION. THE HISTORY
OF THIS CASE IS AS FOLLOWS.
B. MARIANO DESIGNATED HIS MOTHER AND FATHER, BOTH
IN CUBA AS HIS DEPENDENTS. MARIANO ALSO DESIGNATED CARLOS
FERNANDEZ CAMPOS AS HIS TRUSTEE TO HANDLE ALL MONIES FOR HIS
DEPENDENTS.
C. AMTIKI-1'S RECORDS SHOW THAT CARLOS FERNANDEZ
CAMPOS WAS PAID AT THE RATE OF $225.00 PER MONTH FROM APRIL
1961 TO APRIL 1962. ACCORDING TO THE RECORD, ALL PAYMENTS
TO CARLOS FERNANDEZ CAMPOS CEASED AT THAT TIME BECAUSE "CARLOS
FERNANDEZ DID NOT ACCOUNT IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER FOR THE
MONEY RECEIVED." AMTIKI-1 OPENED A SAVINGS ACCOUNT IN THE
COCONUT GROVE BANK IN MAY 1962 IN THE NAME OF MARIANO SANTOS
AND/OR JUAN SANTOS (THE FATHER) WITH HIMSELF AS TRUSTEE.
DEPOSITS OF $225.00 PER MONTH WERE MADE TO THIS ACCOUNT FROM MAY
1962 UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1966 WHEN ALL DEPOSITS TO TRUSTEE ACCOUNTS
WERE ORDERED STOPPED BY JMWAVE. TOTAL PAYMENT TO THIS ACCOUNT WAS
$11,925.00 AND WITH THE EARNED INTEREST OF $1,980.57 THE ACCOUNT
BALANCE AS OF JULY 23, 1968 WAS $13,905.57.

C. THE FIRST INFORMATION RECEIVED THAT MARIANO'S
MOTHER MIGHT ARRIVE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS A COPY OF A
LETTER DATED 14 SEPTEMBER 1967 AND SENT TO MARIANO'S BROTHER
RENE SANTOS FROM J.A. MORALES, THE PRESIDENT OF THE 2586
ASSAULT BRIGADE ASSOCIATION. RENE SANTOS LIVES IN HACKENSACK,
N.J. THIS LETTER ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIPT OF A LETTER FROM RENE
REQUESTING THAT ALL CHECKS FOR HIS MOTHER, CLARA MOLINA,
NOW BEING SENT TO CARLOS FERNANDEZ CAMPOS BE SUSPENDED AND
THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD "WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS" BE ARRIVING
IN THE UNITED STATES. MORALES' LETTER ADVISED RENE TO WRITE
TO THE ANTIKI-1 ADDRESS, WHICH HE PROVIDED AND MAKE THE SAME
REQUEST. HE FURTHER ADVISED RENE THAT HE SHOULD PROVIDE THE
AMTIKI-1 ADDRESS ADDITIONAL BIO DATA ON MARIANO AND HIS MOTHER
AND FATHER.
D. ANTIKI-1 RECEIVED A LETTER DATED 19 SEPTEMBER
1967 FROM RENE SANTOS STATING WHO HE WAS AND THAT HIS MOTHER
CLARA MOLINA WOULD "WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS" BE ARRIVING IN
THE UNITED STATES VIA SPAIN. ENCLOSED WITH THE LETTER WAS A
COPY OF MORALES LETTER (C ABOVE), MARIANO'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE
AND PICTURE.
E. ANTIKI-1 REPLIED AT JMWAVE'S REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGING
RECEIPT OF RENE'S LETTER AND ENCLOSURES AND ADVISED RENE THAT
PAYMENTS TO THE TRUSTEE, CARLOS FERNANDEZ CAMPOS, HAD BEEN
TERMINATED (NO DATE GIVEN) AND THAT MRS. CLARA MOLINA CABRERA
SHOULD NOTIFY HIS OFFICE BY MAIL UPON HER ARRIVAL IN THE U.S.
F. AMTIKI-1 RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MRS. CLARA MOLINA
CABRERA DATED 2 JUNE 1968 STATING THAT SHE WAS NOW IN THE
U.S. AND DESIRES TO DISCUSS MARIANOS' CASE.
G. ANTIKI-1 REPLIED ASKING MRS. CLARA MOLINA TO
FORWARD ANY DOCUMENTS THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TO IDENTIFY HER AS
THE MOTHER OF MARIANO SANTOS MOLINA. MRS. MOLINA REPLIED IN
A LETTER DATED 4 JULY 1968 ENCLOSING HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

PHOTOGRAPH AND PASSPORT NUMBER. MRS. MOLINA ALSO INFORMED
AMT.IKI-1 THAT HER HUSBAND AND THE FATHER OF MARIANO SANTOS
MOLINA HAD DIED 25 FEBRUARY 1962.
2. AMTIKI-1 ON 23 JULY 1968 COMPLETED A BREAKDOWN OF
THE ACCOUNT SHOWING THE AMOUNT IN THE BANK WHICH IS SHOWN
IN PARAGRAPH 1 B. ABOVE, THE AMOUNT PAID TO THE ORIGINAL TRUSTEE
WHICH IS $2,925.00 AND THE AMOUNT DUE MRS. CLARA MOLINA.
SINCE MRS. MOLINA'S HUSBAND DIED PRIOR TO AMT IKI-1 TAKING
OVER AS TRUSTEE, THE PAYMENTS DURING AMT IKI-1'S TRUSTEESHIP
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE RATE OF $175.00 PER MONTH INSTEAD OF
THE $225.00. MAY 1962 THROUGH JULY 1968 (75 MONTHS) AT
$175.00 PER MONTH AMOUNTS TO $13,125.00 AND AS NOTED IN
PARAGRAPH 1 B ABOVE THE ACCOUNT CONTAINS $13,905.57.
3. JMWAVE PLANS TO HAVE AMT IKI-1 WITHDRAW THIS ACCOUNT
AND PURCHASE A CASHIER'S CHECK FOR MRS. MOLINA FOR THE TOTAL
AMOUNT DUE ($13,125.00) AND PASS THE BALANCE OF $780.57 TO
THE JMWAVE FINANCE OFFICER. FOLLOWING THIS AND BEGINNING
WITH THE AUGUST 1968 PAYMENT AMIKI-1 WILL FORWARD A CHECK
FOR $175.00 EACH MONTH TO MRS. CLARA MOLINA IN THE SAME
MANNER AS OTHER BRIGADE DEPENDENTS. JMWAVE PLANS TO HAVE
ANTIKI-1 PROVIDE MRS. MOLINA WITH THE NAME OF THE ORIGINAL
TRUSTEE AND THE AMOUNT PAID TO HIM WITH REGRETS THAT HE CANNOT
ASSIST HER IN THIS MATTER. WE ALSO PLAN TO HAVE AMT IK-1
EXPLAIN THE METHOD OF COMPUTING THE $13,125.00 TOTAL ($175.00
PER MONTH FOR 75 MONTHS). WE DO NOT PLAN TO RAISE THE POINT
OF EARNED INTEREST. WE BELIEVE THAT WOFIRM WOULD HAVE
COMPLETELY FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATION TO MRS. MOLINA BY THE
ABOVE PAYMENT PLUS HER MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO FOLLOW. PLEASE
CONCUR IN THIS PARAGRAPH BY CABLE.

AMTRIGON-8 (201-283995), AMBUD Case #97
ACTION REQUIRED: REFORMED
Reference: UFGW-7040, 29 April 1968
1. AMTRIGON-8 was a member of the VILLARO crew. During
May 1962 he clandestinely and without authorization boarded an
infiltration craft moments before its departure on an
operational mission. His absence was not discovered until the
team had infiltrated and moved into its first position.
2. On 8 or 9 June 1962 the infiltration team, including
AMTRIGON-8, became engaged in a firefight with a militia
patrol. AMTRIGON-2, the team leader, reported that AMTRIGON-8
had been wounded and that he assumed AMTRIGON-8 was killed
or perhaps captured. However, no further word has been heard
from AMTRIGON-8 and he is presumed to be dead.
3. Taking into consideration that the disposition of this
case could have an affect on the morale of the other crew
members and their attitude toward WOFIRM, it was decided to
advise the widow of AMTRIGON-8 that he died a hero's death--
while fighting for the liberation of his country and to continue
monthly payments to the widow and children for an indefinite
period. Inclusion of Subject's name on AMBUD Hero & Martyr
rolls was deemed to be the most suitable and expeditious manner
in which to handle such payments.
4. The response to paragraph 2 of reference will be
the subject of a separate dispatch.

Reference:
UFGW-7020, 11 April 1968
1. ANTIKI-1 has advised that he does not envisage any
problems in closing out the trust accounts. However, since
the bank holding the deposits is relatively small, it was
agreed to accomplish the closing out of accounts over a
period of several months. To this end, the accounts pertaining
to cases #116 (Justo MONTES DE OCA Ceballos) and #114
(Francisco FERNANDEZ Cabrera) have already been closed out
and the funds will be transferred to Headquarters in the
near future.
2. Being forwarded under separate cover is the background
information on the ten trust accounts as requested in reference.

Request for Additional Information on Two AMBUD Dependency Cases
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Action Required:
See Paragraph 1
1. It is requested that Raymond K. PANUSES recheck the file
of Miguel Los Santos DELGADO Martinez (Case No. 97) in an effort
to determine the cause and actual date of his death. Headquarters
file does not reflect this information nor the reason why his
dependents are paid under the AMBUD program. In those few cases
of former active assets whose dependents are paid by AMTIKI, the
exact date and circumstance of death is necessary for documentation.
2. It is also requested that ANTIKI be queried regarding
certain vital documents which should be in the file of Benito
BLANCO Cruz (Case No. 3). A copy of a letter from the widow,
dated 11 January 1962, indicated that her marriage certificate
and the birth certificates of her children were enclosed with the
letter. It is possible, but unlikely, these documents were over-
looked when the file was recently reviewed. In any event, the
work check sheet used by the documentation team indicates these
documents were missing from the file.

1. Headquarters recommends that all reference accounts, with
the possible exception of the PASTRANA account (Case #118), be
closed immediately and the proceeds transferred to Headquarters.
2. It is suggested that AMTIKI be queried concerning any
possible embarrassment he might suffer in his personal relation-

filed in the AMTIKI files. Under the circumstances, it is highly
