1. Forwarded herewith is a contact report from PACHANKIS on his follow-up
Interview of Alexander SAMKO (201-866054), which concerns SAMKO's contact with
AMAUTO/1 (201-735296) in Madrid. As can be seen from the report, Madrid Station's
defensive briefing of SAMKO apparently took effect and he has been cautious in
avoiding the many suspicious characters that have appeared since his trip to
Madrid.
.
2. The question of his writing to MAID/I was mentioned by SAMKO.
He was
told that AMAUTO/1 was back in Cuba and we did not know when he would return to
Madrid, if ever. 13/Miami believes we should wait until AMAUTO/1 returns to
Madrid, or some other post in the Free World, and then have SAMO write to him.
3. Despite SAMKO's newly self-discovered James Bond talents PACHANKIS
enjoyed handling him. It also appears that our primary objective, contact with
AMAUIU/1 for a face to face assessment, has been met.

AUC
On the morning of 28 July, I called Sam to check in with him.
after being away on TOY for almost 6 weeks. He sounded a bit
upset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed
out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set
him at ease.
It was plain to see that the trip had changed him. He is now
a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Bond. He told
me all sorts of wild stories about being tailed in Madrid "by
7 or 8 'Chivatos' (Castro agents, " and leading them on long
"8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid." Castro agents were also
"watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona and on the short
layover his Pan Am plane had in Lisbon on his way home.
time, however, was he molested by these "agents.'
At no
The Castro surveillance continued -so Sam says- in Hollywood.
"About the second night after I got home," c. 14-15 June, a car
parked across the street and a little to the rear of his house.
"after it got dark." When Sam got into his car and went to the
gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volkswagen,
without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trip in
the neighborhood and back to his home. He could not make out
the physical description of the driver of the VW. He has never¨
seen this car again.
The only other suspicious individual near his home, was "a tall,
thin man," (described as about 5-11 to 6 ft and 170 lbs; black
hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slacks and
white shirt, another time wearing a suit). This individual showed
up across the street from his home "just as the sun had gone down,
several evenings during the first week that I got home." (c. 14-19
June) The man just walked past the front back and forth a few times
and appeared to have his car around the corner of Sam's house. He
could not identify the car or anything else about the man.
Again, during the first week after his return Sam received several
telephone calls where no one would answer when the phone was picked
up, or the person calling would say, "sorry, wrong number." Sam
has not experienced any other suspicious incidents after the first
week home from Spain. I should note that Sam does not, talk of
these incidents with fear, but rather in the vein of a paperback
detective story..
Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himself somewhat in Madrid as
a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hotel,
ate as well as drank. well, saw the sites and even went to a night
club, all on the house. He went so far as to say that if he had
"known it was going to be like this, I never would have gone."
in the same breath, he told "William" that he would be back in
Spain in September.
Of course
Sam would go again if we asked him,

Modesty not being one of his greatest virtues Sam rambled and
rambled about the "secrets" he got out of "William" and passed
on to the Madrid c/o. I went along with him and complimented him
on a job well done; which is true. But, he was not satisfied with
