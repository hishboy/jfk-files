Nikita Khrushchov and Fidel Castro at the Likhachov Automobile Works, which they visited the day before May 1.

The workers of the plant were holding a social evening at their Palace of Culture, and the distinguished guest was greeted by thousands of people. Both Nikita Khrushchov and Fidel Castro were presented with models of the ZIL car made at the Works. Before the concert, Nikita Khrushchov, Fidel Castro and his party saw a documentary film about the Works, which was the first Soviet automobile plant.

Famous performers and amateurs took part in the concert, which wound up with the "July 26th March". The last bars were drowned in enthusiastic applause, and cries of "Viva Fidel!" and "Viva Cuba!" resounded in the hall long afterwards.

LEFTIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES-Soviet Directed Insurgency

Monthly CI Report (S) (Gp-1) A Soviet Embassy official in Mexico City, Nikolai S. LEONOV, is allegedly actively planning an insurgent movement in Latin America. LEONOV left Mexico for the USSR on 21 April to confer with KHRUSHCHEV and CASTRO.

OSI District 30 May 1963

Credence is given this report by the publication of a photograph of the three on 8 May in a Cuban newspaper. The photograph was purportedly taken during a recent meeting.

(S) (Gp-1) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV's schemes, would serve as bases for the insurgency. Cuba would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for covert distribution of arms.

(S) (Gp-3) The individual selected as the contact man for arms acquisition is said to have been engaged in similar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.

(S) (Gp-3) Another report from sources in Colombia stated that pro-CASTRO ex-President CARDENAS planned to call a meeting in Mexico City of "leftist bent", disgruntled retired military officers from Latin American countries on the subject of insurgency. (DIA, 3 June 1963)
