UFGA-3797/02, (CKA-123) 12 Apr 62, 19-9-9.

One Eduardo Tomas TORRES Ramos said that he was (had been) Chief of Security for DRE in Sagua la Grande, and that for all practical purposes the resistance has been liquidated in Sagua la Grande. As Chief of Security his job was to hide and exfiltrate people fleeing from Cuba which he said was the last remaining job that the resistance could do.
