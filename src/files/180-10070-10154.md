Final Determination Notification

AGENCY: HSCA
RECORD NUMBER: 180-10070-10154
RECORD SERIES: STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER:

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 3

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Noncontroverted [ ] Controverted [ ]

We have received Form CA-1 reporting an injury and your agency's response to the evidence submitted. It has been determined that:

[X] 1. The facts of the injury and employment support the employee's contention that he/she was a Federal employee who sustained a traumatic disabling injury in the performance of duty. You should, therefore, continue his/her pay for the period of disability not to exceed 45 days.

[ ] 2. The information of record is insufficient to make a decision on the case; however, you should continue the employee's pay without interruption. Additional information is required as noted on the reverse of this letter.
