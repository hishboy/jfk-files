Final Determination Notification

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Dick:

While the attached resume of Ms. Miriam Rudder does not reflect experience related to office duties, I know her well and certainly trust her. Therefore, I strongly recommend that she be hired for me to train as a mail clerk working along with Patricia Price. Again, as I indicated above, the most important thing to me in this instance is that I have the utmost trust in Miriam.

Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.
