Interview:
Investigator Robert Buras spoke with Sgt. Roberts relative to
the attached report dated Aug. 12, 1963. Roberts stated that
he was in company with Sgt. Horace Austin who actually made the
report. The Officers spoke with all the arrested subjects in one
room at the same time. The only interest at that time was to
ascertain the possiblity of trouble from any individual or group
represented by the arrested subjects. Feelings were high in the
room and Roberts had to caution the Cubans to keep from trying to
argue with Oswald. At one point in the interview the Commanding
Officer of the First District, Captain James Arnold, came into the
room and asked Oswald if the Fair Play For Cuba Committee was
communist or a communist front. Oswald denied that he was a com-
munist and that the organization was a communist front. Oswald
stated that he joined the F.P.C.C. after finding a leaflet on the
street and sending $5.00 to New York. He also stated that he met
with members locally but did not want to give any names etc.
Roberts stated that he did not see or hear anything about
Oswald wanting to call or talk with an F.B.I. Agent while he was
there. Roberts couldn't remember any other details about the in-
terview.

arrest from Canal Street.

Sir:

The following information is respectfully reported relative
to the interview of four arrested subjects in the First District
Police Station, beginning at about 4:45 P.M., Friday, August 9,
1963. One of the four subjects, identified as Lee Harvey Oswald,
WM, age 23, residing 4907 Magazine Street, had allegedly been
distributing communist literature on Canal Street, and three
Cubans, the other three arrested subjects, had become involved in
an altercation with Oswald, which resulted in the arrest of the
four subjects.

Lee Harvey Oswald furnished the following information when
interviewed.

He is a member of The Fair Play For Cuba Committee, whose
address is 799 Broadway, New York 3, N. Y., telephone OR4-8295.
Oswald had in his possession a National Membership card issued on
5/28/63, and the president's name on this card was "V. T. Lee."
Oswald had also a local membership card dated 6/6/63 (N.O. Chapter
of the FPFCC), and the president of the local chapter, whose name
was on the card was "A. Hidell."
Oswald presented his Social Security Card, which did not bear his
signature, and the number of this card was 433-54-3937.

Oswald presented his U. S. Marine Corp. discharge card (Honorable)
bearing service number 1653230, and date of active duty from
24 Oct 1956 to 11 Sept. 1959.

Oswald stated he was born in New Orleans on October 18, 1939,
that he is about 5' 9" tall, about 140 lbs., and is a mechanic by
trade. He stated he did mechanic work in the Marine Corps, and
that he is presently unemployed and has been so about three weeks.
Before he was laid-off, Oswald stated, he worked at the Louisiana
Coffee Company for about three months, and before that he had
worked at Fort Worth, Texas, at a sheetmetal place. Oswald stated
he worked in Fort Worth at the sheetmetal place for several months,
but was very evasive in answering any further questions of
employment prior to that time.

Oswald stated that he lives with his wife, whose maiden name
was Marina Pross, WF, age 21. They were married in Fort Worth,
have one child seventeen months of age, and reside presently at
4907 Magazine Street, lower center, New Orleans.

Oswald stated that he has two brothers, who reside, like his
mother, in Fort Worth, Texas. He stated that his father, John Lee
Oswald, is deceased.
Oswald's mother: Margarette Oswald, resides by herself in
Fort Worth, Texas.
Oswald's brothers:
Robert Oswald, WM, age 27,
John Oswald, WM, age 32,
Oswald stated he had talked to Major Trosclair about getting a
permit for F.P.F.C.C. and the Major advised him to consult his attorney.
Oswald said he never did go and see about a permit at city hall.
Oswald further stated the Cubans came up to him where he was
giving out the leaflets and began to tear them up and throw them
in the street. Oswald stated that they started to yell that he
was a communist and about that time the officers from the First
District came up and a crowd had gathered. Oswald stated he joined the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee when he found a leaflet on the street
one day and read what was on it, and sent $5.00 to the address
which was in New York city and after a brief period of time he was
sent material through the mail and contacted locally, and he started
to attend the meetings, which he stated were held in each others
homes. Oswald stated they, the members, get together and talk
about how it would be to visit Cuba, life in Cuba, etc..

Oswald denied the organization was communist, or a communist
front, when asked by Captain James Arnold, Commanding Officer of
the First Police District, who came in during the interview, but
Oswald had in his possession and was carrying a piece of card-
board with "VIVA VIVA Fidel" painted on it and the paraphernalia
he was handing out was pasted on this cardboard also. Oswald
stated he has never been to Cuba, and it appeared as though he
is being used by these people and is very uninformed and knows
very little about this organization that he belongs to and
its ultimate purpose or goal. Oswald stated that the people that
attend these informal meetings are working class people, such as
clerical, trades, etc..
