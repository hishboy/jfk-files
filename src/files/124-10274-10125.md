Women's Bail Fund
Unless otherwise stated, all sources in
this memorandum have furnished reliable
information in the past.
On March 30, 1971, a first confidential source
furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which
was picked up at the Upper Westside Womens Center, 627
Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York (NY) on March 27, 1971.
The literature captioned, "Women's Bail Fund" argued that the
Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should
not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the
prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the
power structure here in America to oppress and exploit the people
of poor communities." It further relates that "Women have come
together in New York from many different organizations to form a
Women's Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of
Detention. The Bail Fund is also working to prepare simple
pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal
resources in the House of Detention and secure legal assistance
where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,
P.O. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.
On August 26, 1971, the first source furnished
literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The women's
Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:
"...raising bail to release women prisoners from
Rikers Island,
"...establishing communication with women inside.
"...assisting women who are bailed out in meeting
their needs.

"...providing legal information for prisoners.

On April 12, 1971, a second confidential source
made available a flyer on the Women's Bail Fund which was
distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on
April 10, 1971. The flyer, captioned, "Victory to the NLF and All
Oppressed Peoples" states "Women in Vietnam and in the United
States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right
to exist.....the U.S. is now dotted with concentration camps for
the poor and non-white: the jails.....But imprisonment doesnt'
break the spirit of the sisters in jail. They resist! When denied
their dignity, they organize and fight back. When one sister is
beaten they organiz and resist. In the coldest part of winter
when the boilers had broken down, the women worked in freezing
temperatures in cold water to do the laundry-not 'because the
pigs made us do it - but for our 'own beautiful sisters.' .....We
Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are
united in our struggle - we share common goals and face a common
enemy. We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall
work to bring the victory there."
On May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a demonstration in front
of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Women's
Bail Fund and Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF). The
demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release of their
"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move
of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its
downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison Facility. The
demonstrators called this proposed move an attempt to isolate
the "sisters from their supporters."
By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to
several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the
upper storey windows, obtained their names and place of arrest.
This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the
prisoners in question. Thereafter, several speakers denounced
the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the
"political prisoners," in the House of Detention. Among the
speakers was Shirley Taylor of the Women's Bail Fund and a
former inmate of the Women's House of Detention.

YAWF
YAWF is the youth group of the Workers World
Party (WWP).
WWP
The WWP was founded in 1959 by individuals who
disagreed with policies of the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP). The WWP dissidents advocated
unconditional support of the Soviet Union and the
building of a revolutionary party geared to the
overthrow of capitalism. More recently the WWP
has called for peaceful solutions to Sino-Soviet
disputes, however, the WWP generally supports the
People's Republic of China in its ideological
differences with the Soviet Union.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
A third confidential source advised on May 18,
1971, the Women's Bail Fund has called for victory for the
Vietcong and is setting up a "phone chain" to be able to call
for "action against the transfer of women from the House of
Detention to Rikers Island."
On June 6, 1971, the third source advised the Women's
Bail Fund will have a "major bail out of women" from the Women's
House of Detention from June 10 to June 13, 1971 at the Washington
Square Methodist Church. It will include four
days of "discussions, films, counseling and information services"
for inmates and their families. The coordinator for the Bail
Fund was identified as Pam Engle, telephone number 989-6717.
On July 26, 1971, SAS of the FBI observed a picket-
type demonstration at 51st Street and Avenue of the Americas
protesting the existence of all jails. Among the groups
represented was the Women's Bail Fund.
On August 4, 1971, a fourth confidential source
advised the following checks were among those drawn from the
bank account of Lubell, Lubell, Fine and Schaap, Attorneys-at-
Law, 103 Park Avenue, NY, NY.

On January 6, 1972, the first source made available
a one page leaflet distributed through the mails by the Women's
Bail Fund and dated December, 1971. The leaflet is a request
for funds for the Bail Fund with the notation that donations
are tax exempt. The leaflet, in part says, "The Women's Bail
Fund is one arm of the growing nationwide prison solidarity
movement. During the past year we raised bail to release over
120 women who have been imprisoned while awaiting trial....."
On January 23, 1972, a seventh confidential source

is subscribed to by the Women's House of Detention Bail Fund
and rented by Mary C. Pinotti, 86 East 3rd Street, NY, NY
(Telephone 777-5823.)
The third source advised on February 10, 1972 the
Women's Bail Fund is trying to obtain a grant from the NY
People's Life Fund (PLF), however, they have been advised by
the PLF that they may receive a loan rather than an outright
grant. The source advised the Fund participated in a
demonstration a month ago at the New York City Correctional
Institution at Riker's Island, NY, however, said its activities
seem to be limited. The source advised that two principal
activists of the Women's Bail Fund are Amy Lowenstein and Gerry
Tosca.
The NY PLF is a fund set up by the War Tax Resistance
(WTR) to grant loans or funds to local groups in
the NY area.

Women's Bail Fund
A first confidential source advised that Beverly Sterner,
Channel 13 News, 304 West 58th Street, New York, New York,
is affiliated with the Women's Bail Fund (WBF).
An article appeared in the March, 1972 issue of
the "Liberated Guardian", captioned "Women's Bail Fund;
Organizing Our Anger", written by five unidentified members
of the Women's Bail Fund Collective.
The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a
group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women
out of jail (150 so far). They have been organized for over
a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,
1970. They have been active in supporting other groups
involved in the prison struggle. They do legal follow-up
for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking
with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who
the real enemies are, etcetera."
The article is introduced by the following
statement:
"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.
So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from
as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these
reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."
The article, being reflections of the various
members of the group, is a series of quotes by unidentified
members concerning the WBF.

Women's Bail Fund
The following are reflections of some WBF
members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots Why
We Started Why We Joined".
"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising
group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting
started and she talked with others about it. To some of
us it was a very exciting idea. To others it was
frightening connecting to political activity as women.
Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on
whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness
to any sort of feminist political action or not.
"In the past, I was politically frustrated because
I was only involved in one-shot actions. I saw what was
happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress
black people and that resulted in a lot of pain for me. I
felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.
I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware
of that need.
"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.
When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my
head. I make judgements like this judge is better than another
one, but it's all shit. All judges are pigs. Or like
feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five
years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.
"I was in the House of Detention when there was the
bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970. The whole
tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she
let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows. As
the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.
They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated
and intimidated about chanting. But all the women kept it
up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration
was different than other demonstrations. There had been more
contact. The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman
that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.
That was real important.
"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund
banner with the address made it real that people were serious
about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a
one-shot deal.

The following are reflections carried under the
sub-caption "Questions We Are Facing Right Now".
"There's a real dialectic between reform and
revolution. So much of what we do is short-term support
stuff that can be seen as reformist. When prisoners raise
these demands it's understood to be revolutionary; when
people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be
reformist. I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,
both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole
social work thing is what I come out of, which is why it
is so hard for me to deal with all this ('cause I obviously
reflect a lot of that work). Social work when it started
back in the late 1800's and early 1900's came out of real
radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such. And
when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people
as a revolutionary thing. But for us it feels weird
because it has been co-opted. I think that the movement
now, trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that
original sense of service to the people, trying to help
people survive.
"One of the ways to really keep ourselves
out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in
more political education among ourselves and to ask other
groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we
should be more involved in educating other people.
"We should be doing more for women inside. We
need to really work on facilitating communications
between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners
have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is
because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.
Concretely, we need to write more letters to find out what
is going on, send literature, but also tell the women about
each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.
This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the
sense of solidarity.
"I think much of the movement is guilty of
ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot
of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately
wanted. We're too afraid of being contaminated by being
involved in reform movements. We too often define our
enemies too broadly and our allies too narrowly.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the
group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they
fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res-
ponsibility affects new members too. This is real
important. It helps me through the rough times and all
the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.
You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work
things through, search for solutions, wants to hold
together because we feel responsible for the work. Even
the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are
sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain
why they have to stop doing work for a while, shows
people's commitment and responsibility."
The "Liberated Guardian" was created in
April, 1970, through active and violent
dissent against the politics and policies
of the "Guardian". Its major aims were
to produce a "more revolutionary" paper,
to operate collectively within it and to
maintain by design a loose political position.
The "Guardian" is self-described as an
"independent radical newsweekly" which
takes a strong left position but is not
identified with any organized group. It
is considered to be the largest radical
weekly in America.
A second confidential source advised an account
for the WBF was opened on July 6, 1971, for $3,500. The
account was closed ten days later on July 16, 1971. This
account was opened by Patricia Reiner of 2451 Aldrich
Avenue South, Minneapolis. Reiner, on August 30, 1971,
submitted a forwarding address of 855 South Cedar Lane,
Valparaiso, Indiana 46383.
A third confidential source advised the WBF
set aside money for Constance Trimble at the First National
Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The source advised two accounts
were opened for the WBF on behalf of Trimble. One account
was a savings account in the amount of $2,000; the other
was a checking account in the amount of $2,800. The
trustees for these accounts were listed as Neil B. Dietrich
or Catherine Collins.

Constance Trimble was tried and found
not guilty on a charge of first degree
murder for making a telephone call
which lured a St. Paul, Minnesota
police officer to an ambush slaying
which occurred in 1970.
On April 5, 1972, and April 8, 1972, a fourth
confidential source advised Jennifer Dohrn and Judith
Clark were in contact with various members of the WBF
on these two days.
Judith Ann Clark is a member of the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
Weatherman faction and was underground
in 1970 prior to her arrest on December 17,
1970 by Special Agents (SAS) of the FBI
New York City, as a result of an outstanding
arrest wanted for unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution mob action. Clark was
indicted by a Federal Grand Jury at
Chicago, Illinois in April, 1970, prior
to her arrest. She was sentenced to
three years, for which she spent nine
months in the Cook County Jail, Chicago,
Illinois, and was released in July, 1971,
to serve the remaining time on probation
in New York City.
Jennifer Ellen Dohrn is the sister of
FBI Top Ten Fugitive Bernadine Rae Dohrn.
Both sisters are alleged members of
the SDS - Weatherman faction.
SDS was founded during June, 1962, at
Port Huron, Michigan, and in the 1960's
functioned as the leading New Left campus-
based student organization in the United
States. From a stance of "participatory
democracy," the SDS moved to a radical-
revolutionary position. It maintained a
national office at 1608 West Madison Street,

Chicago, Illinois, until February, 1970.
Internal factionalism during 1969 produced
three main factions: Weatherman, Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), and Worker Student
Alliance (WSA). The Weatherman and RYM no
longer consider themselves associated with
the SDS. The WSA faction continues to use
the name SDS.
On April 14, 1972, a fifth confidential source
advised that Judith Clark was in touch on April 3, 1972,
with a Beth Last Name Unknown (LNU), at 466 East 48th
Street, Brooklyn, New York, concerning the WBF.
The source advised that Clark, on November 5,
1972, was in touch with an unknown female and discussed
the Wednesday night meeting of the WBF. Clark discussed
the fact that Jeannie LNU, Estelle LNU and Laurie LNU
would be at the meeting at 5:30 PM, that evening at Clark's
residence. The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi LNU,
both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at
the meeting. Clark discussed the fact that the WBF
has no common politics and no common political direction
at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,
not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack
of any other direction.
The source advised that on the same day, Clark
was in touch with Amy Lobenstine from the WBF at telephone
number 663-1136, and both agreed to attend an education
meeting of the Fund.
The fifth confidential source further related
that Clark was in contact, on April 8, 1972, with a
Marilyn Dalsimer, 254-4498, and a Shelley Lawrence,
663-1136. Both were identified by the source as being
associated with the WBF.

(00:NY)
Re New York airtel and LHM, 8/28/72, and captioned
as above.
On 11/28/72, INFORMANT advised the Women's Bail Fund
(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the
movement in New York City.
A review of the subject file discloses there is no
structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who
belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main
purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.
It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted
those involved in the bail fund. However, have decryed the
lack of political direction of the WBF and would like to turn
it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other
direction. There is no indication, that this has occurred, and
the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded
individuals from various groups seeking to raise funds for
various purposes. Because of its lack of common political dir-
ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in
the movement.
In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-
gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of

Copies of this memo are being disseminated to
local intelligence agencies of the Army, Navy, and Air

The WONAAC is self-described in its liter-
ature as being formed by the national con-
ference of more than 1,000 women held in
New York City, New York, in July, 1971.

At that conference, women from twenty-nine
states and two hundred fifty-three organi-
zations came together to unite their
efforts in the national fight for the re-
peal of all abortion laws and for the
corollary demands of no forced steriliza-
tion and repeal of contraception laws.

The conference called for a massive show
of force for these goals in a march on
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco,

is based on a program of legislative,
judicial, and mass demonstration
activities on a local and national level,
and seeks to unite all women in the fight
for the right of abortion.

On November 20, 1971, Special Agents of the
San Francisco Office of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) observed that approximately five hundred
individuals, primarily young women in their teens and
early twenties, gathered at the Embarcadero, San Francisco,
California, and began marching at 11:10 a.m. from the
Embarcadero, en route to the Civic Center, San Francisco.
They carried signs such as "free our women" and "separate
church and state". By 12:30 p.m., the marchers had
arrived at the Civic Center where a female rock band was
performing. A rally was held at the Civic Center from
approximately 1:45 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., addressed by indi-
viduals supporting repeal of abortion laws.

There were no incidents or arrests with regard
to the march and rally, according to San Francisco Police
Department records, and the official police estimate of
the crowd attending the rally was approximately five
hundred individuals.

The Sunday, November 21, 1971, edition of the
"San Francisco Examiner", a San Francisco, California,
daily newspaper, in an article entitled “Pro and Anti-
Abortion Forces Hold Rallies", described HELEN MEYERS,
one of the speakers at the Civic Center rally, as
Regional Coordinator for WONAAC.

Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, 11/20/71 and Abortion
Law Repeal Sponsored by Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC), SM - New Left".

Information was received at Cleveland, Ohio that
an organization called the Abortion Project Coalition (APC)
had formed in Cleveland and was planning to attend a demon-
stration in Washington, D.C. on November 20, 1971 sponsored
by the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC).
Subsequent investigation and information supplied by reliable
sources revealed that the APC had been formed to campaign
for abortion law reforms.

On October 29, 1971 a reliable source advised that
the APC had established a headquarters at 11220 Bellflower,
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, telephone 368-2248, which is
located in Flora Mather Hall, Case Western Reserve University
(CWRU). Source further advised that Lauri Lee Perkus, Robbie
Scheer and Sue Tryon were the leaders of APC all of whom
were associated individually with the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP).

Scheer stated that about 5,000 women attended the Women's
Liberation March in Washington, D.C. on November 20, 1971,
including a bus of approximately 10 women from Cleveland.
The Cleveland YSA according to source, considered 40 a good
number for the first women's liberation march.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE (YSA)
CLEVELAND, OHIO

The Cleveland branch of the YSA is the
youth group of the SWP in Cleveland.

On December 22, 1971 above source advised that on
December 21, 1971 Robbie Scheer had stated that there were
some intersession classes being held at CWRU, Cleveland, Ohio,
by the APC. These are three classes in Women's Liberation:
one on Abortion, one on Women's Literature, and one in
Psychological Aspects of the Women's Liberation Movement.

On December 22, 1971 a reliable source advised that
about 2,000 - 2,500 persons attended the march and rally for
abortion law reform on November 20, 1971 at Washington, D.C.
of which approximately 50% were Female and 20% were male.
Source stated that the march was fairly orderly and source
noted only one minor incident which occurred at a theater
along the route that was showing the movie "The Sex Machine".

There was no destruction and no arrests were made.

On January 10, 1972 Tony Zeomac, University Circle
Police Department, Cleveland, Ohio, advised that his office
had received numerous leaflets and references to the Abortion
Project Coalition, which is located at CWRU, but that his
office did not consider the APC a subversive organization
in its own right. He further advised that to the best of his

BLOOMINGTON ABORTION COALITION

On November 8, 1971, Sergeant John Tomlinson, U. S.
Park Police, Washington, D. C., furnished a permit applica-
tion for a demonstration to be held November 20, 1971, at
Washington, D. C. The sponsoring organization was given as
Women's National Abortion Action Coalition, 917 15th Street,
Northwest, Washington, D, C. In addition to the main
sponsoring organization, other sponsors were also listed and
included in those listed was the Bloomington Abortion
Coalition, 702 Atwater, Bloomington, Indiana, 47402.

On November 10, 1971, a confidential source who has
furnished reliable information in the past advised that a meeting
of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) was held at Indiana
University, Bloomington, Indiana, on November 2, 1971. At
the meeting, a discussion concerning the Washington, D. C.,
demonstration of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
(WONAAC) was held, at which time Paula Savich, head of the
women's faction of the YSA and Chairwoman for the Bloomington
Abortion Coalition (BAC), gave a report. Savich stated that
bus tickets for the November 20, 1971, demonstration to be
held in Washington, D. C., would be sold in Bloomington on
November 8, 1971. Savich stated that the local chapter,
which is the BAC, would be asked to assume fund-raising
quotas and help to pay debts incurred by the national
organization. Savich encouraged all YSA members, both male
and females, to travel to Washington, D. C., for the
demonstration. It was also discussed that male members of
the YSA would be expected to assume part of the transporta-
tion costs by YSA women who participated in the November 20,
1971, demonstration at Washington, D. C. According to this
source, the BAC is backed primarily by the YSA at Indiana
University and the Chairwoman, Paula Savich, is a member of
the YSA at Indiana University. The organization was formed
by the women's faction of the YSA principally for attendance
at the Washington, D. C., demonstration.

As the youth organization of the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) serves
as the main source of recruitment into that organization.
The YSA is described in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A
multinational revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

On November 18, 1971, the confidential source listed
above and a second confidential source who has furnished
reliable information in the past advised approximately 15
individuals would be attending the demonstration in
Washington, D. C., from Indiana University, Bloomington,
Indiana. The individuals traveling were to represent the
BAC headed by Paula Savich, Chairwoman and YSA member.
Included in those scheduled to travel were approximately five
or six members of the YSA from Indiana University and plans
were for individuals to travel in two Ford Econoline vans
rented from U-Haul, Bloomington, Indiana. Original plans had
called for a bus to be chartered; however, the lack of
individuals signing up to attend the demonstration resulted in
the cancellation of the bus.

On November 16, 1971, an article entitled "Abortion
Repeal March Plans Set" appeared on page 12 of the "Indiana
Daily Student", a local campus daily newspaper. The article
indicated approximately 40 students were to travel to
Washington, D. C., and that Student Body President Mary Scifres
had been invited by the WONAAC to speak at a rally on the
Capitol steps in Washington, D. C. According to the article
Scifres had not decided whether or not to accept the
invitation. Paula Savich, Chairwoman for the local committee,
according to the article, stated, "It is important that this
march be really big". She indicated that they were taking
reservations for the bus trip to Washington.

On November 24, 1971, the first confidential source
mentioned above advised that the BAC in Washington, D. C.,
participated in the demonstrations as scheduled. Source in-
dicated that no problems arose from the demonstration.

According to the source, Indiana University Student Body
President Mary Scifres did not attend the demonstration but

NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 76

--- Page 674 ---

BLOOMINGTON ABORTION COALITION

did send a statement which was to be read at the demonstration;
however, due to difficulties, this statement was never read.
According to source, between 15 and 20 persons actually
attended the demonstration who were from Indiana University.

On November 30, 1971, an article appeared on page 9
of the "Indiana Daily Student", supra, captioned "Women
March for Abortion Reform". The article stated that less
than the forty students who had been expected to attend the
demonstration actually attended. The article indicated that
the large number of persons expected to attend the
Washington, D. C., demonstration from all over the country
did not materialize. The article also stated that Student
Body President Mary Scifres, who had had to decline an
invitation by the demonstration sponsors to speak at the
march because of obligations at Indiana University, prepared
a statement to be read. Her statement and several other
statements, however, were not read because of the lack of time
due to frequent breakdown of sound equipment delaying speeches.
According to the article, Paula Savich had expected a better turn-
out from Indiana University.

On January 17, 1972, the second confidential source
mentioned above advised that the BAC was not currently active
and that it was not expected to be active in the near future
unless other demonstrations such as the demonstration held in
Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, called for support
from Indiana University. According to this source, the
BAC had been formed principally by members of the YSA, namely
Paula Savich, who was Chairwoman for the BAC and who currently
heads the women's faction of the YSA at Indiana University.

BOSTON WOMEN'S ABORTION
ACTION COALITION

A source who has provided reliable information
on November 1, 1971, advised as follows:

The Brush Hill Transportation Company, Dorchester (Boston),
Massachusetts, telephone number 527-1818, had ordered
five buses with a forty-five person capacity each from
the Brush Hill Transportation Company, Dorchester (Boston),
Massachusetts, for travel to Washington, D. C., on
November 19, 1971; and a $1,500 cash deposit against
a total cost or $3,500 was made on November 15, 1971.
The buses were scheduled to depart for Washington, D. C.,
at approximately 9:00 p.m., November 19, 1971, from
the Purity Supreme Market Green Street, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and the cost of the round-trip ticket was $18.

A second source who has provided reliable
information in the past, on November 17, 1971, provided
the following information:

Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition
(BOWAAC) is made up of local Female Liberation (FL)
groups. While BOWAAC is not exclusively made up of
Boston area YSA and SWP members, it is controlled by members
of those groups.

Matilde Miles, nee Zimmerman, was the Boston
SWP member heading up local SWP/YSA work in the
Coalition; and she and Evelyn Clark, another SWP,
Boston, member, had left or were planning to leave for
Washington, D. C., to help in organizing the November 20,
1971, WONAAC scheduled demonstration at Washington, D. C.,
and both planned to remain in that area through the
demonstration.

At a meeting of the SWP, Boston, held November 16,
1971, it was reported that the local BOWAAC was hoping to
fill four buses with participants for travel to Washington,
D. C., for the November 20, 1971, demonstration but that
a specific number of actual participants from this area
was not then known.

The New England Telephone Listing Service
personnel on November 17, 1971, advised that telephone
number 547-1818 is listed to BOWAAC, 552 Massachusetts
Avenue, Cambridge, and that telephone number 491-1071
is listed to FL located at that same address.

At approximately 10 a.m., November 20, 1971,
Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) observed women who represented various women's
groups from cities in the United States, including Boston,
gathering on the Ellipse in Washington, D. C. At approxi-
mately 12:10 p.m., the group, then numbering about 1,500,
was observed to march from the Ellipse to the West Front
of the Capitol;, and during the march to the Capitol, signs
carried by some of the marchers were observed to read
"Rhode Island Women for Abortion Reform" and "Boston
Repeal All Abortion Laws".

The Special Agents also observed that two tables
of SWP literature were set up during the gathering at the
Ellipse and four at the rally site at the Capitol. The
rally ended about 4 p.m. without incident.

The second source, on December 3, 1971, advised
that the organizer of the SWP, Boston, had recently re-
ported that between eighty to one hundred individuals
had traveled from Boston to Washington, D. C., to partici-
pate in the WONAAC November 20, 1971, demonstration.

BOSTON WOMEN'S ABORTION
ACTION COALITION

"The Militant," a weekly newspaper of the SWP,
in its November 14, 1971, edition carried the following
announcement: "Abortion Conference The Second National
-
Conference of the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition will be held February 11-13, 1972, at Boston
University. For further information, contact WONAAC,
150 Fifth Avenue, Suite 843, New York, New York 10011.
Phone (212) 741-0450."

On January 12, 1972, the second source advised
that SWP, Boston, and YSA-B members active in BOWAAC
were distributing a "Housing Fact Sheet" to locate housing
accommodations for individuals visiting the Boston area
to attend the above-scheduled conference at Boston
University February 11-13, 1972. This Fact Sheet listed
the BOWAAC office at 552 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge,
telephone number 547-1818.

This second source further advised as follows
on January 12, 1972:

BOWAAC was originally a subcommittee of the FL
group locally but has now grown into a separate group
whose specific interest is in abortion reform. Both
BOWAAC and FL in the general Boston area are located at
the same address, 552 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge,
but have separate offices at that address.

Individuals active in BOWAAC are also active in
other FL work; however, all individuals active in FL work
are not active in BOWAAC.

The SWP and YSA in the Boston area have approxi-
mately fifteen of their FL members active in FL work with
approximately six to eight of this number in and the
controlling forces of BOWAAC. Jane Roland, who joined
the SWP, Boston, in late 1971, is now heading up the
Party's faction work in FL and BOWAAC; and Matilde Miles
and Evelyn Clark continue on a leave of absence from
the SWP, Boston, and to work at the National Headquarters
of WONAAC.

A third source who has provided reliable information
in the past, on January 17, 1972, advised that Patricia F.
Putnam, President of Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts,
residence 162 Hampshire Street, Cambridge, telephone
number 547-8557, under the sponsorship of Boston University
FL has reserved Hayden Hall, Boston University, and fifty
classrooms located in the College of Business Administration
College of Liberal Arts, Boston University, also the location
of Hayden Hall, for the period February 11-13, 1972, for a
"conference open to the public." According to the third
source, it was requested that five of the fifty classrooms
have a seating capacity of seventy-five or over.

This third source further advised that Patricia
Putnam, Social Security Number 024-36-7397, as of the
1970-1971 school year was listed as a senior in the College
of Liberal Arts (CLA), Boston University, with a residence
at 35 Glencoe Street, Brighton (Boston), Massachusetts.

The third source advised that the 1971-1972
Boston University Listing of Students shows Putnam as
still a CLA senior with residence as of the September,
1971, registration at 90 Lake Street, Newton, Massachusetts.

The Boston SWP is the local affiliate
and follows the aims and purposes of
the national SWP.

SIMILAR (CONT'D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street rallies and picket lines, and the direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the FPCC had been dissolved.

This article states that Mrs. Zeldin has been in peace demonstrations in Madison, Wisconsin and was a registered peace lobbyist in the State of Wisconsin.

The article also discloses that Mrs. Franz is an observer and delegate from the Madison Womens’ International League for Peace and Freedom.

The "Milwaukee Sentinel", local daily morning publication, Milwaukee, Wisconsin in its issue of January 16, 1968 disclosed that Milwaukee Alderman and Milwaukee Common Council Member, Mrs. Vel Phillips, Mrs. Bertha Rubin, 3948 North Murray Avenue, Shorewood, Wisconsin and Mrs. Leon Fis, 2822 North 67th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin had participated in the Jeannette Rankin Brigade March on Congress in Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968.

SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D.C., JANUARY 15, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING

On January 24, 1968, a confidential source reported five members of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade delegation from Washington State went to Washington, D.C. on United Airlines Flight 69 leaving Seattle shortly after 8 a.m., January 13, 1968. The group consisted of the following:

HELEN FRENCH
ELAINE HORSLEY
LONNIE HEALY
TAIMI HALONEN
THORUN ROBEL

The first source advised in January, 1968, HEALY, HALONEN, and ROBEL are members of the Communist Party (CP) at Seattle.

The first source went on to state the Seattle delegation was met at Baltimore Friendship Airport by THOMAS BLACKBURN who resides at 9406 Saybrook, Silver Springs, Maryland. BLACKBURN carried a store-resisting "6" Seattle Ladies Bag which apparently had been made up with the anticipation of there being one more woman in the group. BLACKBURN questioned each person as to her organizational affiliations, with emphasis on church and peace groups. HEALY, HALONEN, and ROBEL all indicated they are with Women Strike for Peace. FRENCH said she did not represent any particular group, and HORSLEY said she was active in her church and interested generally in Peace. BLACKBURN said he and his wife are with the American Friends and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. BLACKBURN took the Seattle group to his home. On Sunday morning BLACKBURN invited the women to attend church but only FRENCH accepted. The others said they were going sightseeing in Washington, D.C.

With regard to Women Strike for Peace (WSP), the "People's World", West Coast communist newspaper, in its issue of October 20, 1962, quoted Dr. FRANCES BATERING, national leader of WSP, as stating the organization "was composed of autonomous local groups open to women of any race, religious creed or political ideology."

On May 3, 1968, a third source made available a leaflet distributed by Seattle Women Act for Peace (SWAP) (see appendix), local affiliate of WSP which stated in part, that Mrs. DONNA ALLEN, a national leader of WSP, Mrs. DAGMAR WILSON, founder and leader of WSP, and RUSS NIXON, General Manager of the "National Guardian" (see appendix) were "found guilty of contempt in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia for refusing to testify at a closed meeting of HUAC (they had expressed a willingness to testify at an open HUAC hearing)."

The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is the social outreach arm of the religious group known as the Society of Friends (Quakers).

The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, according to a fourth source in July, 1961, held its annual meeting at St. Paul, Minnesota, from June 26 - 30, 1961. Resolutions passed at the conference included the following proposals: support the repeal of the recent Supreme Court decision which sustained the constitutionality of the registration provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and the membership provisions of the Smith Act; favor social and cultural exchange, non-intervention in Cuba, abolition of the House Committee on Un-American Activities and ban further nuclear testing.

The first source went on to state the Seattle delegation went to Room 132-A, Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C., early Sunday evening, January 14, 1968, where a Steering Committee for the demonstration the following day was meeting. Among those present were MARY CLARKE, Los Angeles, California; JUDITH MORSE-EATON of Connecticut; and ELEANOR FRENCH of New York who did not give any sign of being related to HELEN FRENCH of the Seattle group. LONNIE HEALY inquired several times about other Seattle people who might have arrived separately. She also questioned the absence of Negroes on the committee and sought to have a resolution adopted on American Indians. In connection with the Indian matter she distributed a leaflet, a reproduction of which is set out at the end of this memorandum.

Later MARJORIE RADER, EMELIA CASSIDY, LINDA CORR (Negro) and ZEFRA STUDAMIRE (Negro) arrived at the Shoreham Hotel. The source did not know ZEFRA's last name, but it is given later in this memorandum by another source. These four indicated they were being housed at DONNA ALLEN's home in Washington, D.C. RADER joined HEALY in questioning the lack of representation on the Steering Committee of representatives from minority groups.

MARJORIE RADER and EMELIA CASSIDY were reported by a fifth source in January, 1968, as being CP members at Tacoma, Washington, and ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was described as a 16-year old Negro girl who has been active in the Young Political Explorers League (YPEL) (see appendix) at Tacoma.

LINDA CORR was reported by the second source as being a CP member at Seattle as of January, 1968.

Following the Steering Committee meeting the group went to dinner. The Seattle delegates met a Mrs. DUNLAP from Pasadena, California, and a MARIE SBEARDSLEY from Encino, California. DUNLAP said she had been working on a signature campaign for the Peace and Freedom Party of California which was not further described. BEARDSLEY said she works in an

office which coordinates the activities of peace organizations. BETTY MEREDITH of Marin County, California, and formerly of Seattle, stopped at the Seattle table and reminisced with HALONEN and ROBEL "about the old days in Seattle." (ERICA NIEDER, formerly of Tacoma, Washington, and now of Cleveland, Ohio; inquired of RADER about some people in South Tacoma. From the reaction, it was assumed by the source NIEDER is not closely associated with anyone in whom RADER has an interest.)

Following dinner, the Washington State delegation went to Shoreham Suite A-409 occupied by VIVIAN HALLINAN of California. Several California women were there to hear instructions for Monday. Rumors were rampant. One person said police would plant two hundred "agent provocateurs" in the line of march to create scenes which would result in arrests. It was also stated police had prepared for five hundred arrests; that all telephones into the demonstration headquarters were being monitored; and that permission to march was still being withheld. After the California group had been briefed, the following instructions were read to the Washington delegates by MALVINA REYNOLDS of California:

(1) Maintain silence throughout the march.

(2) Maintain strict discipline; walk to the right on the sidewalk.

(3) Follow the instructions of monitors in blue armbands who will be under orders from white arm-banded marshals.

(4) Surround and isolate any trouble makers.

(5) Carry at least $10.00 on your person, preferably $25.00.

(6) Remove all items from your purse that might be considered a weapon; i.e. nail files, hat pins, etc. Remove all addresses except home and emergency addresses from purse.

(7) Don't wear dangling earrings for if one should fall they might cause injury if someone reached out to assist you and caught hold of the earring.

The telephone number of the Brigade headquarters was given for use in case of arrest.

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self-critical about not working for the programs the younger women were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January 20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation, however, that the women working on the program were all very experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in Washington, D.C. It was learned here that the instructions which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were evidently for the California group only, because many California people had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed "Jeannette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions. A reproduction is attached.

The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a Mrs. BACKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected by Mrs. BACKUP. Reverend HAROLD ASS of Tacoma collected $120.00, and wanted someone else to go instead of ZEFRA (STUBAMIRE). RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks something about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from New York did include a paragraph from the paper the Washington State delegation submitted to Congress. This was entitled, "American Indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation from Washington State)."

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING, Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the basic organization of the gathering. She wanted an organizational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN worked in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as "resource people" for the group. She said she thought this was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a situation that was quite different in that she was working with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented individuals and it was a real learning experience. ELAINE HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY, and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem and would be unable to attend. Mrs. BACKUP joined the group. LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON, but they were not in their offices. After leaving a copy of the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment) they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and BROCK ADAMS. Mr. HICKS was out of town. Mrs. HORSLEY knew the Congressman personally and her son knew two of the office personnel. She asked that they relate to him that she was vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his political views and some of the political machinations of his party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her son who is attending Harvard University.

After some sightseeing in the afternoon, HALONEN, ROBEL, and Mrs. BACKUP checked into the Plaza Hotel since they were going to stay a day or two longer for some workshops. RADER stayed also. The rest of the group, HEALY, CORR, ZEFRA (STUDAMIRE), CASSIDY, and FRENCH went to Friendship Airport and boarded UAL Flight 41 for Seattle.

While in Washington, HEALY kept trying to call a CARL BLOICE who the source thought used to be either in Seattle or San Francisco, but she never reached him.

The workshops held on January 15th after the march were:

(1) Legislative Action
(2) Electoral Campaign
(3) Press
(4) New Women in New World
(5) War at Home
(6) Resistance
(a) Action
(b) Draft
(c) Direct Action

On January 23, 1968, the fifth source advised a meeting of the Trade Union CP Club was held at Tacoma, Washington, on January 18, 1968, at which EMELIA CASSIDY, also known as MILLIE CASSIDY, a member of that club, reported on her trip to Washington, D.C. She stated she stayed at DONNA ALLEN's home there. She said MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to the march. RADER remained at ALLEN's residence. She added ZEFRA STUDAMIRE shouldn't have gone because she was uncooperative and would not attend anything. She was rude, said her bed was too low and complained about the food. Some or all of these

-7- CONFIDENTIAL

troubles might be attributed to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting a baby in April. CASSIDY stated there were too many rules to follow.

The delegates weren't permitted to carry a nail file, wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons. They had to walk six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this denial of their rights. She went on to state each person had or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN M. COOK, had been very helpful to the group. COOK told CASSIDY she could be reached at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information is desired concerning Veterans for Peace, which was not further described.

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't easy to stop. She was incensed over the fact money had been used for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate. RADER and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference to handle some business with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) according to CASSIDY.

SNCC is an organization which has concerned itself with racial matters in the United States.

On January 24, 1968, the second source reported a Jeannette Rankin Women's Conference was held at the Mt.

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D.C., JANUARY 15, 1968

The Washington Cultural Cooperative, which operates the Co-op Bookstore, (see the appendix) was selling brigade literature to raise funds to send to Seattle Brigade delegates to Washington, D.C. for the battle. There.

Opening remarks at the meeting were along socialistic lines, according to the source. The principal speaker said capitalism is a rich-man's democracy, while socialism has democracy for the workers.

There were workshops on such topics as schools, young people, working women, and draft resistance. When the groups reassembled after lunch, some of the delegates to the Jeannette Rankin Brigade affair at Washington, D.C. gave short talks. The speakers were CORR, ROBEL, and CASSIDY. All of these have been characterized before as members of the CP. All of these five spoke as mothers who did not want their sons to go away to fight a rich man's war. They stated the war had not proved anything in the past and had been wrong and women should come to the front and tell their sons not to be cannon fodder.

The working women's workshop presented a resolution in favor of a black women's lobby to Olympia, the capital of Washington State. A heated debate arose between some of the black and white women present. The latter contended black women had been discriminated against and this was wrong and that they were trying to separate themselves from other women. The former contended equally that Negroes, too, had been discriminated against. A CP member, who was present to try to be united, said these differences had been built up over hundreds of years and that one meeting would not solve all the difficulties but could be a start in solving them. They should sign then they could argue openly.

The "Brigade Literature" distributed at the meeting included: "American Indians and the Struggle for Peace"

INDIANS AND THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE

Today, in Battle Creek, Michigan, the city's seal, adopted in 1851, meets with protest and violence because it pictures a white man hitting an unarmed Indian with a rifle butt. Some Indian youth view the television program "Gunsmoke" as indicative of racist America. The National Congress of American Indians opposes this distortion of history. Beatings and murder of Indians in Maine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 1953 to open up Indian land reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this overrides established tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier in Viet Nam. In the three years before 1967, more Indian children below the age of 18 had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of the entire Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joke to white Americans. We pay because we don't know our own history.

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history of Indian-Americans. When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived. This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding the Viet Nam war. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with United States' genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct the history and policy of genocide against the Indian people. Today this refers to the destruction of their identity as a people and linke with the struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy of genocide, of racism, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of the crimes against the Indian people? We, the women of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, are committed to this.

All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without making this correction of what was done to the American Indian people.
