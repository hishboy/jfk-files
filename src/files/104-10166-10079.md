DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station
FROM: Chief, Special Affairs Staff
ACTION:
OPERATIONAL/TYPE: Letters Received by AMCORE-2
REF: As stated below
SUBJECT: UFO 3613, 3 January 1963

1.  Headquarters appreciates receiving the enclosures to UFO 2737 and the reference. The usefulness of this material, however, could be enhanced considerably if AMCORE-2's source were guided as to the items to be diverted. Also, headquarters envisions an excellent possibility for placing or exchanging items, were it possible to communicate with AMCORE-2's source. Could this be achieved, a profitable relationship with the source might develop, gradually dropping AMCORE-2 out of the picture.

2.  JIGNAVE is requested to try to get the identity of AMCORE-2's source and/or to consider ways to establish contact.
