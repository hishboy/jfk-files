As a western visitor, nothing impressed me more than the great power of this country. Every person in New China is very modest but has great pride; they are united, have self-respect, and respect each other. No one can overlook China's advance; it is to be regretted that many people do not have the opportunity to observe it personally. I like Shanghai very much, because from the way Shanghai has changed I can really understand New China. In the old Shanghai, except for the Chinese, everyone had special privileges. However, everything has changed greatly. I am of the opinion that from this, one can see the miracles which have begun in this great country."
