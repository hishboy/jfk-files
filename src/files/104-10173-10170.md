Attachment A is a memorandum furnished to the local CDACID which reviewed the derogatory information in Station files on Subject. Attachment B is a paraphrased copy of the CDACID cable to Washington recommending a favorable decision in his non-immigrant visa case.

Peter Nax LESNICK y Menendez, non-immigrant visa applicant born 8 1930 in Vueltas, Las Villas, Cuba. Profession, salesman.

President of Juventud Ortodoxa and Orthodoxo party leader in opposition to BATISTA. He is currently in hiding from police until the heat is off. In 1954, he signed the Comite Cubano declaration in favor of Guatemala. Pe was referred to as a Communist sympathizer through collaboration between Ortodoxos and Communists and friendship well- known Cuban Communists possibly embracing Section 212 (a) (27) and (28). Security checks show no indications of collaboration with Communists. Latter at times tried to get on the bandwagon of all opposition groups including the Ortodoxo. Specific information from Cuban Government sources regarding Ortodoxo-Communist pacts were later admitted to the local CAS as fabrications. LESNICK states that he signed the Pro- Guateriala declaration against big foreign business domination of Latin American affairs as did many other Cubans. He states that he is only acquainted with student Communist leaders at the University of Habana, He denies that he collaborated with the Communists during the past or resent and brings published articles dating back to 1950 which indicate his anti-Communist stand. His name appears in the Soundex for questioning.

The local CAS is especially interested in the case. A favorable decision is recommended by the visa officers.

LESNICK plans attend Inter-American Press Association meeting to be held 12 October in Washington, entering New York 12 October at 1:35 p.m. via Cubana airline.
