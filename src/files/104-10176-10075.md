MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7

According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER, LITAMIL-7, who was recruited by
LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67, was never a very productive asset.
Although Subject did provide information on activities of the installation and individuals working therein, in approximately 1969-70, Subject was retired by the PBRUMEN Embassy, ending her previous usefulness. In spite of this loss of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with the personnel, including the ambassador. For this reason, we maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly upon retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them. This was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when she was working in the embassy.

2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as approximately six times in home. The last time she was told that in view of retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the embassy, our relations with would be terminated. However, if she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This, of course, never happened.

3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, WHR did receive spot payments for the information submitted. Subject also received occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday.

termination was amicable, and Subject agreed to notify LITAMIL-3
if she had any information of value to report.
