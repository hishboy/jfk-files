MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services Career Service Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion from GS-12 to

GS-13 for Mr. Jerome A Fox

1. FE Division recommends the promotion of Mr. Jerome A.

Fox from GS-12 to GS-13.

2. Mr. Fox first joined the Agency in 1955 in the DDI. He rose

rapidly from GS-07 to GS-12 which grade he achieved in March 1961.

He spent one overseas tour in Tokyo in the Factory Markings Program.

In April 1963 he transferred to the DDP. This action and the adia-

ments it necessitated have undoubtedly held him back from the normal

career advancement to be expected for one of his ability.

3. In the DDP Mr. Fox first served in Vietnam Operations in

Headquarters and then from 1964-1966 in Saigon. There he performed

effectively in both liaison and unilateral operations with elements of

the Vietnamese police. He personally recruited several agents and

established a successful mail intercept unit. He was first recommended

for promotion to GS-13 during his Vietnam tour.

4. In November 1965 Mr. Fox joined FE/PMI, first on the

Indonesian and currently on the Philippine Desk. He has served as

the Indonesia Desk and Branch referent for Communist Party Operations

where he proved himself to be an excellent analyst. He has also served

as a desk officer handling a variety of projects. He has performed his

duties in a consistently strong manner, and has shown sound operational

judgment. Mr. Fox writes well, and gets along extremely well with

his co-workers and contacts. He is now scheduled for a field Assignment

in Manila in 1969. In view of his strong Headquarters desk performance

and his previous recommendation from Vietnam, Mr. Fox was recommended

for promotion again in February 1968.

5. Mr. Fox is an experienced and competent Headquarters and

field operations officer. He has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to

perform at the GS 13 level. In consideration of his fine record of

productivity I recommend that he be promoted to

GS-13.
