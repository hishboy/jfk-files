MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division
FROM: David H. Blee
THROUGH: Chief, Career Management Staff
SUBJECT: Manpower and Support Branch/Contract Amendment to Contract for George Martin Rosnek

1. Action Requested: It is requested that the contract for George Martin Rosnek, an Independent Contractor, be amended to increase his compensation from $37,270 to $41,270 per annum effective 8 April 1979.

2. Background: In September 1978 Mr. Rosnek, a former senior officer of the KGB, raised with his case officer the question of prior financial commitments made to him by the Agency. Specifically, he claimed that the Agency still owed him $20,000 of an original commitment of $50,000 made to him at the time of his defection. This $20,000 claim has become an obsession with Mr. Rosnek and is likely to affect negatively his relationship with the Agency unless resolved to his relative satisfaction. Attached for background information are documents relating to Mr. Rosnek's claim.

3. After careful consideration of the equities involved in this case it is my belief that security considerations dictate that we settle Mr. Rosnek's claim in the following manner. I will approve an increase in his annual payment by $4,000 effective April 1979 (from $37,270 to $41,270). Thereafter, his annual compensation would be increased each October in the amount identical to the cost of living increase given to US Government employees. (This cost of living provision is currently in his contract). However, at such time

as Mr. Rosnek reaches the salary paid an employee in the top step of GS-15 (currently $47,500) his annual compensation would be increased only as the pay for that step increases.

All other terms and conditions of said contract, as amended, remain in full force and effect.

SUBJECT: PDDONOR
REFERENCES: Memo Dated 16 February 1970 From DC/Security Research Staff
Memo Dated 14 August 1972 From DC/Security Research Staff
Acknowledgement and Release Form Dated 12 July 1973

1. A careful review of the PDDONOR file substantiates the fact that there were three unequivocal financial commitments made to PDDONOR at the time of his defection in February 1964. These three commitments were:

a) He would be paid $25,000 for each of the two years he cooperated in place. Total $50,000.
b) He would receive $10,000 for his part in identifying William Vassal, a British Admiralty employee as a KGB agent.
c) He would receive $25,000 per year salary from the Agency.

2. The question at issue now is whether an additional commitment was also made to PDDONOR to the effect that the Agency would provide financial assistance to him to purchase a home.

According to PDDONOR, on 30 January 1964 in Geneva prior to his defection in a conversation with his case officer, Mr. Tennent Bagley he stated, "I will arrive with what I have on my back no home - no roof no anything." The reply to PDDONOR was as follows; "This will be taken care of. It will be provided." This exchange in PDDONOR's view, constituted

what he believes was a commitment on the part of the Agency to provide him with financial assistance in the purchase of a home. A memorandum dated 16 February 1970, written by Mr. Bruce Solie describes this verbal exchange between PDDONOR and his case officer. (See Reference A). In addition, a memorandum dated 14 August 1972 also written by Mr. Solie (Reference B) states that "Nosenko stated that prior to his defection in Geneva, he discussed his future with Bagley and made three requests, these being:

a) Employment at $25,000 per year;
b) $50,000 in an account
c) Assistance in purchasing a house

According to Nosenko, Bagley a day or two later, informed Nosenko that his requests had been approved and Nosenko considers this constituted a valid verbal contract

From PDDONOR's viewpoint therefore an additional commitment, quite separate and apart from the three listed in paragraph 1 was made to him. Consequently, he now argues that a payment made to him in July 1970, in the amount of $20,000 and which he used as a downpayment on a house, was the fulfillment of this additional commitment and not part of the $50,000 he was promised for his two years in place. This despite the fact that in the 14 August 1972 memorandum as Mr. Solie states in paragraph 5, "Nosenko also considers that the assistance in purchasing furniture, a house, etc., which he has been given since 1969 should be considered as cancelling the matter of the $50,000."

What seems to have occurred is a change of position on PDDONOR's part. While previously acknowledging that the original $50,000 commitment had been met (paragraph 5 of Reference B) PDDONOR now takes the position that of the below listed payments only $30,000 should be applied against the $50,000 commitment. The July 1970 payment of $20,000 should be applied against a separate commitment to provide assistance in purchasing a home.

$2,000 in March 1964
$8,000 in May 1969
$5,000 on 1 July 1970
$20,000 on 1 July 1970
$15,000 on 12 July 1973
(According to PDDONOR this payment should not be applied against the $50,000 commitment)

Thus, according to PDDONOR's reasoning $20,000 is still due him as part of the original $50,000 commitment.

Several additional points should be noted. On 12 July 1973 PDDONOR signed an "Acknowledgment and Release" prepared by the General Counsel in which PDDONOR releases and forever discharges the US Government and the Agency from any claim for money promised to him. (Reference C) In addition, the issue of the $20,000 he says is still owed him does not surface in the file until September 1978 14 years after his defection. The explanation of why this issue would arise at this late date is not clear from available records.

Attached are copies of those documents which impact on this issue. Because of the complexities of this case I recommend that we request the Office of General Counsel to review the entire case and provide a ruling on the legitimacy of PDDONOR's claim of $20,000. After such a ruling we can discuss our future course of action.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Counterintelligence
FROM: John A. Rizzo
SUBJECT: Financial Commitments to PDDONOR/1

This is in response to your memorandum of 23 February 1979 which requests our opinion concerning existing financial obligations to PDDONOR/1, a former high-ranking KGB officer who defected to this country in February 1964 after having cooperated in place for the previous two years. Based on information contained in CI Staff files, there appears no question that the Agency made three documented, unequivocal promises to PDDONOR/1 at the time of defection:

a) he would be paid a total of $50,000 ($25,000 per annum) in consideration for his previous two years' service in place;
b) he would receive a $10,000 payment for his part in identifying a certain KGB operative in the British government; and
c) he would be placed under contract for "an indefinite period" after his defection at a yearly salary of $25,000, with accompanying provision for retirement and other benefits.

Your memorandum seeks our assistance in resolving the issue of whether or not the Agency has, as PDDONOR/1 asserts, any current, independent obligation to pay PDDONOR/1 $20,000 based on an oral commitment made to him by a now-retired CIA officer at the time of his defection promising him the Agency's financial assistance in his securing a residence in this country.

2. As you know, due to unforseen and extraordinary factors which arose shortly after PDDONOR's defection, the three documented commitments made to him as outlined in the previous paragraph were not fulfilled until some years after his defection. In this connection, the file indicates that PDDONOR/1 did not start receiving an Agency salary until March 1969, and that it was not until six years later that he began to be paid at the previously promised rate of $25,000 per annum. Accordingly, in order to belatedly satisfy in full the commitments originally made to PDDONOR/1 in 1964, lump-sum payments have been made to him on three occasions in recent years with the approval of senior Agency management. Briefly, these lump-sum payments consisted of a) $125,000 (less taxes) in November 1972 to cover the balance owed for salary during the period April 1964 to March 1969 b) $15,000 in July 1973 to settle the remainder due on the $50,000 obligation to PDDONOR/1 for his service in place overseas prior to his defection, and c) $28,500 (authorized in April 1976 but evidently not paid until late last year) to cover the balance of his previously promised $25,000 annual salary for the period March 1969 - March 1975 as well as the $10,000 commitment originally made to PDDONOR/1 prior to his February 1964 defection (see paragraph 1(b) above) for his role in identifying a certain KGB operative in England.

3. As previously stated, the sole issue for consideration at this point revolves around PDDONOR/1's relatively recent assertion that CIA still owes him $20,000 as a result of a vaguely worded oral commitment made to him by a now-retired Agency officer in 1964 who promised that CIA would provide housing for PDDONOR/1 in this country following his arrival. In analyzing PDDONOR/1's contentions in this regard, we believe for the following reasons that the details surrounding CIA's July 1973 payment to him of $15,000 assume particular significance and do, in fact, firmly rule out any further, outstanding legal obligation to him with respect to payments to cover PDDONOR/1's eventual purchase of a home. Of course, the key consideration involved is the fact that the $15,000 payment was made following PDDONOR/1's execution of a quitclaim prepared by this Office through which he agreed to "release and forever discharge...the Central Intelligence Agency...from any claim for money promised to him for, and/or at the time of his defection, and from any and all other claims...in any form whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with his cooperation and association with... CIA prior to the date of this document, 12 July 1973."

SECRET

--- Page 13 ---

14-0000

SECRET

Thus, the wording of the quitclaim is clearly and purposefully unconditional and is specifically intended to bar the kind of belatedly raised claim which PDDONOR/1 is making now.

4. In taking this position, we recognize that one could properly point out in rebuttal that notwithstanding the seemingly all-encompassing scope of the quitclaim, a further payment of $28,500 was in fact subsequently authorized for PDDONOR/1 in April 1976. However, as was noted in an internal OGC memorandum dated 1 April 1976 which concurred in this additional $28,500 payment, the real purpose of the 12 July release was to settle once and for all the issue of the balance of the $50,000 owed PDDONOR/1 for his two years of in-place cooperation prior to his defection. Accordingly, since the $28,500 payment was intended to satisfy other existing commitments to PDDONOR/1 (i.e., back-salary owed for 1964-1969 as well as the $10,000 promised for his role in identifying the KGB operative in England), this office concluded at that time that the payment was legally permissible since it was outside the intended scope of the quitclaim and was being used to fulfill separate, fully documented promises of compensation made earlier to him.

5. By contrast at the time that CIA made its July 1973 payment to PDDONOR/1 in return for his quitclaim, the available background materials contained in the files you have provided us leave little doubt that the issue of compensation to cover his purchase of a home was an intrinsic part of the calculations which led to the decision to authorize the $15,000 payment to him at that time. For instance, in the 25 June 1973 memorandum to Mr. Colby which contained the recommendation for the $15,000 payment, the Director of Security delineated some of the previous advances made to PDDONOR/1 in partial satisfaction of the $50,000 owed to him for the 1962-64 period. It was specifically noted in that connection that "[a]gainst this ($50,000) sum in April-May 1969, [PDDONOR/1] was given $8,000 as financial assistance for resettlement in the private economy and $25,000 in mid-1970 towards the purchase of a new house and other related expenses:" (Emphasis added). These amounts plus an additional $2,000 which had been previously advanced were subtracted from the original $50,000 commitment, this leading to the final figure of $15,000 that was subsequently paid to PDDONOR/1 in July 1973 and for which he readily signed the quitclaim releasing CIA from any further financial obligations to him. The Director of Security's memorandum went on to indicate that PDDONOR/1 "agreed" with these calculations; moreover PDDONOR/1's acknowledgment that CIA had previously fulfilled its

SECRET

14-0000

SECRET

commitments to him regarding a house is more explicitly documented in a 14 August 1972 memorandum for the file from the Deputy Chief, Security Research Group, which quotes PDDONOR/1 as saying that he "considers that the assistance in purchasing furniture, house, etc. which he has been given since 1969 should be considered as cancelling the matter of the $50,000". (Emphasis added).

Therefore, from all of the above, it must be concluded that, contrary to PDDONOR/1's assertions, CIA has long since fulfilled any promises which Agency representatives made to him prior to his defection concerning his housing in this country. Further, the available evidence clearly tends to indicate that PDDONOR/1 fully understood and accepted the fact that these obligations had been met at the time that he signed his quitclaim in July 1973. Thus, since the terms and scope of the quitclaim are fully controlling on the claim which PDDONOR/1 is asserting, we have determined that the Agency has no legal obligation whatsoever to pay him the $20,000 which he seeks.

As a final note, this office recognizes that, notwithstanding the absence of any legal obligations, the particularly sensitive status of PDDONOR/1 within CIA may nevertheless give rise to an understandable desire in some quarters to make the $20,000 payment to him on security and/or moral grounds. We do not necessarily quarrel with such a view, nor do we mean to imply that CIA is legally precluded from, in effect, "waiving" the terms of the quitclaim if it so chooses. At the same time, it must be remembered that this Office was asked to prepare the quitclaim at issue in 1973 precisely in anticipation of a situation such as the one before us now. It is respectfully submitted that such documents will cease to have any future efficacy or credibility whatsoever if individuals such as PDDONOR/1 who are ostensibly bound by them perceive a willingness on the part of CIA to set aside these carefully worded and legally binding documents whenever a claim (no matter how ill-founded) is advanced. In short, we hope and trust that any decision to pay PDDONOR/1 the $20,000 at issue despite the quitclaim and documented evidence to the contrary will be based on truly compelling security or moral considerations.

SUBJECT: Contract Amendment for Mr. Bruce A. Bertotally
REFERENCE: Memorandum from Chief, CI Staff, dated 20 December 1977

Referenced memorandum pertained to a formal request to amend Subject's contract to provide authorization for specific operational expenses.

Paragraph five (5) of Subject's current contract, among other things, provided for "other expenses". It is our opinion that the intent here was to provide authorization for expenditures for "Operational" purposes. The language being general and non-restrictive in nature, it would follow that any expenditure deemed by you, as the operating activity, to be of an operational nature, and so authorized, would be within the framework of the authorization and that there would be no need to specifically identify and additionally authorize the item and/or its value. Accordingly no action is taken upon your request, it being presumed that you already have adequate contractual authority.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Contract Personnel Division
FROM: David H. Blee
THROUGH: Chief, Career Management Staff
SUBJECT: Manpower and Support Branch/Contract Contract Amendment for Bruce A. BERTOTALLY

1. Action Requested: It is requested that the contract for Bruce A. BERTOTALLY, an Independent Contractor, be amended by changing the last sentence of Paragraph 5, Allowances, Travel, and Other Expenses, to read as follows:

"If, in the course of this contract, you are directed to travel or are authorized to incur other expenses, reimbursement of such expenses will be made on a commuted rate basis, based on constructive cost in the Washington metropolitan area. This commuted rate sum will not be reduced by any operational entertainment that may be provided to you."

2. Background: Because of the current wording in paragraph 5 of BERTOTALLY's contract, C/PCS/CSS/B&F believes that a reduction in BERTOTALLY's commuted rate entitlement must be made when operational entertainment (meals) are provided him by his case officer. This interpretation is based on the present wording in the contract stating that reimbursement for expenses will be in "substantial accordance with CIA regulations." Since under CIA regulations a reduction in per diem is effected when meals are provided by the Government, C/PCS/CSS/B&F believes the language of the contract should be amended to permit operational entertainment (meals) to be provided to Subject without resultant deduction in his commuted rate reimbursement

3. All other terms and conditions of the contract remain in full force and effect.
