1. COS DOES NOT QUESTION POSSIBILITY COVERAGE CUBAN PROBLEM FROM JAMAICA MIGHT BE EXTENDED BUT BELIEVES DELEGATION SUCH AS AMBUD WHOSE PRESENCE OVERT WOULD PROVE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. STATEMENT OF PRIME MINISTER GUSTAMANTE 4 SEPTEMBER THAT GOVT WOULD NOT ALLOW JAMAICA BE USED FOR COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE AGAINST CUBA MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. REASON FOR THIS STATEMENT IS CONTINUING AND FREQUENTLY REITERATED CONCERN OF JAMAICAN GOVT FOR SAFETY OF 25,000 JAMAICANS RESIDENT IN CUBA.

2. STATION FEELS CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS MADE IN GAINING COVERT SUPPORT THROUGH RUABBE FOR CI EFFORT AGAINST CUBANS WHICH WAS EXTENDED TO SOME ACTUAL ASSISTANCE FOR ANTI-CUBAN ACTION DURING CARIBBEAN GAMES.

FURTHER SINCE VERY DIM VIEW TAKEN OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF DR FRANK DIAZ SILVEIRA BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHEN HE INDICATED 14 AUGUST HE WOULD SEEK PERMISSION OPERATE ON ISLAND AS AGENT OF COUNCIL, COS DEFINITELY OF OPINION AMBUD

TYPE DELEGATION IN JAMAICA WOULD BE HARMFUL TO KUBARK AND ODYOKE INTERESTS (SEE KNGS 0123).

3. COS PREPARED CONSIDER ASSIGNMENT STAFF OR CONTRACT AGENT TO JAMAICA UNDER MEMKYBX NON-OFFICIAL COVER TO HANDLE CUBAN AND RELATED HAITIAN AND DOMINICAN PROBLEMS. HOWEVER WOULD PREFER STAFFER UNDER OFFICIAL COVER TO SHARE KUTUBE/KUWOLF GENERAL STATION OPS. EMPHASIS HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE BE ON CUBAN COVERAGE. WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TRAINED IN COMMO AND ADMIN.

4. IN VIEW PRODUCTIVE LIAISON AND DEVELOPING UNILATERAL ACTIVITIES STATION COULD INCREASE REPORTING NOW IF SECRETARY ADDED TO ABSORB ADMIN CHORES.

5. REQUEST HQS CONSIDER ASSIGNMENTS PROPOSED BY COS.
