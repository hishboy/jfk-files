1 am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract was structured in such a way that as the bottoms of other companies became obsolete, they could only be replaced with Onassisâ€™ tankers. Even ARAMCO had to, by attrition, within a period of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years, would have, if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced by Onassis tankers.

Our statistics, after having studied the contract and making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years, Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during the most severe year of the Korean War, that in the first year his profit would be approximately $17 million dollars, that after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the area of $200 million.

While this analysis is going on, we also found that a million dollar pay-off had been made to one of the top ministers in Saudi Arabia and we had the evidence out of the Swiss bank accounts, in other words, contrary to what a lot of people believe they can't be broken and we even in those days, they were broken and we had the evidence with all of the documentation.

We then prepared our inputs and presented them to the National Security Council --

Mr. Maheu. -- of the United States, and within a matter, I believe, of forty-eight hours, our State Department denounced the agreement. It was the first time that anyone had actually seen what this meant, and frankly, there was an innate fear that with the initial $17 million, then there would be no way of stopping, I mean, he might go to Venezuela and do the same thing, and there were also other inputs about the background of Mr. Onassis that I would just as soon not make a matter of record, but they were not too favorable, that we presented to the National Security Council verbally but not in writing.

Mr. Madigan. Who made the presentation?
Senator Schweiker. What subsequently happened then with the Security Council denunciation, et cetera?
Mr. Madigan. The State Department denounced the agreement and that same evening we were told that two of the top CIA officials were on their way to Saudi Arabia.

Then I proceeded to dig up the gentleman by the name of Carl Twitchell by virtue of reading about the country, because I'm not about ready to go there and not know about the customs and the formation of the country. I dug up a man by the name of Carl Twitchell who was living in Connecticut who turned out to be the first American who had ever really been accepted by

old King Saud. Mr. Twitchell had spent time in the country as a mining engineer to help them in the exploitation of mines. It was in fact to Carl Twitchell that the old king gave the power of attorney to come to the United States government or come back to the United States and try to form a consortium for the exploitation of oil from which emanated ARAMCO.

Carl Twitchell was the type of man who was only reimbursed for his expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king was then gone and King Saud, the son, was in power, Mr. Twitchell had the same respect and reverence from the present leaders as he did from the father and I convinced Mr. Twitchell that he already had a clearance, a satisfactory clearance, and I convinced him to precede me to Saudi Arabia to try to lay the groundwork.

Senator Schweiker. What year was this, roughly?
Mr. Maheu. This, I believe, was in '54 or '55, yes.
Anyway, I finally ended up going to Saudi Arabia, having a meeting with the King's confidential assistant, presenting all of this evidence, frankly at the time not knowing if the King himself had a piece of the action --

Senator Huddleston. Had some of this evidence come from the wiretap?

Mr. Maheu. That tap was entirely unproductive, entirely unproductive.

Senator Schweiker. What happened then at your meeting?
Mr. Maheu. Well, it's very interesting, if we could take a little time, I mean, I was scheduled to have the meeting "with the King," but he doesn't show, he stays somewhere else and the confidential assistant shows up and one trusted minister that he had with him present.

And my meeting was scheduled for 8:00 p.m. one night, and this happened to be the last day that the King was supposed to be in Jidda, he was then leaving for the capital further inland, Jidda being the only major port in Saudi where he spends his summers, and they were having a big parade for him, and from the balcony of the hotel, I'm watching the parade go by, and finally the King's car comes and he is arm and arm with the man on whom I'm going to give the evidence that night, and I frankly was not too comfortable, particularly in view of the fact that in those days -- and I don't know whether it has changed, but in Saudi, the same document did not give you permission to enter and leave; you had to make application for an exit visa after you arrived, and I was in constant contact with the then-United States Ambassador. He made it very clear that the government approved of everything I was doing, but if something went wrong they could not come to my rescue, I would have to be the fall guy, and I was prepared to do it. That was

Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high seas, and at the time that all of this is going on they are building what then, upon completion of production, had been the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick. But finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and a half years to do it.

Senator Schweiker. I didn't mean to get you off the track.
Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verbose.
Senator Huddleston. You said you bought a paper in Athens? You mean by that you actually bought the paper or just paid them to run the story?
Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper.

You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those days, there were fifty newspapers. I mean, the big circulation in those days, big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard for us to visualize that.

Senator Huddleston. The CIA supplied the money to buy the newspaper?
Mr. Maheu. Yes.
Can we go off the record?
Senator Schweiker. Yes.

Mr. Liebengood. Was this listening post that you referred to, was that a project that was related to work for the Central Intelligence Agency?
Mr. Maheu. I don't believe it was.

Mr. Madigan. Did you have any New York assignments other than Onassis that you gave to Frank?
Mr. Maheu. I don't remember any.

Mr. Madigan. How about Thomas Evans? I may have asked you that yesterday. Do you recall whether he had any relationship with your company during the 1950's?
Mr. Maheu. I don't remember a Thomas Evans.
Mr. Madigan. A CIA employee.
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall his name.

Mr. Madigan. I got sidetracked off of my question of whether you recall a prosecution or an investigation of the Onassis wiretap. You may have already have answered that.
Mr. Maheu. I think I did, yes.

Mr. Madigan. What did you say?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I appeared before a Grand Jury that was investigating Mr. Frank on another matter.

Mr. Madigan. On another matter, but you had no recollection of any investigation of that particular tap?
Mr. Maheu. No, I don't.

Mr. Madigan. You don't remember it?
Mr. Maheu. No.
Mr. Madigan. Let's go off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Madigan. Did there come a time when you were asked by the Central Intelligence Agency to be involved in a project which would involve sending a woman by the name of Florence Horn over to a foreign country?
Mr. Maheu. Yes, sir.

Mr. Madigan. And what were you asked to do with regard to that?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I was asked to find a woman, preferably from Los Angeles, who would go to a foreign country and under some pretext try to meet the Leader of the country and hopefully change his basic philosophies which at the time were thought to be detrimental to the United States, and that they were very, as a result, very seriously jeopardizing the national security of the government of the United States.
Mr. Madigan. Did you find such a woman?

Mr. Maheu. Yes, I did.
Mr. Madigan. And did the Agency sponsor her overseas, that is the CIA placed her in touch with a representative of the CIA?
Mr. Maheu. He made certain commitments, financial commitments to her. At the completion of the assignment, she claimed that she had additional funds coming to her which I paid out of my own pocket, so that I guess the short way of saying it is that the Agency and I sponsored her trip.

Mr. Madigan. Did she ever get to meet the foreign leader, whom we will call Leader A?
Mr. Maheu. I do not have any recollection.
Mr. Madigan. You don't know whether she did or didn't?
Mr. Maheu. I don't have any recollection.
Mr. Madigan. Do you know how long she was gone?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that she was gone for several months.
Mr. Madigan. And this person is the woman I referred to earlier by the name of Florence Horn, is that right?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.

Mr. Madigan. Now can you date that assignment as sometime in 1956 or '57, does that sound about right, or do you have any recollection of what year it was?
Mr. Maheu. I don't have any recollection. It was before

1960.
Mr. Madigan. It was sometime after you had begun in '54 with your Agency operation?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.
Mr. Madigan. Or your sponsorship?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.

Mr. Madigan. Subsequently, did this Leader "A" come to the United States to your knowledge after this?
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall whether he came subsequently or prior to.

Mr. Madigan. When the same leader did come to the United States, were you involved in any assignment for the CIA with regard to his presence in the country?
Mr. Maheu. Yes, I was.

Mr. Madigan. And what was that assignment?
Mr. Maheu. I was told by the State Department and the CIA that this leader would be in need of female companions and that the government was very much concerned that the type of women that would be secured for him might eventually be very destructive to the national security of the United States government unless said women had been cleared by local police departments in several of the cities in which he was scheduled to travel.
Mr. Madigan. Who was the Agency representative that gave you this assignment? Did you go through Mr. O'Connell, or was

it someone different?
Mr. Maheu. This request emanated from, directly from the State Department.
Mr. Madigan. Who in the State Department?
Mr. Maheu. Mr. Scott McCloud, who was then Director of the Office of Security and Consular Affairs.
Mr. Madigan. Was it coordinated with the CIA, or was this strictly between yourself and the State Department?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that the CIA was kept apprised, however that the coordination was with the State Department, in connection with the security that was being provided for this leader during his visit to the United States.
Mr. Madigan. Did you meet with the State Department or CIA people or both in New York City when the leader arrived there?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I met with Security Personnel of the State Department.
Mr. Madigan. What did you do in New York for this assignment?
(Pause)
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall.
Mr. Madigan. And did you meet with the New York police with regard to the assignment?
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall.
Mr. Madigan. Did you obtain or send over any females over

Mr. Maheu. I don't recall.
Mr. Madigan. Do you recall telling me yesterday that you did send girls over there?
Mr. Maheu. No, I don't.

Mr. Madigan. Did you travel from New York to any other city with this leader?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I did.
Mr. Madigan. What occurred when you arrived at the other cities?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I contacted the security representatives of the State Department.

Mr. Madigan. And after you contacted the security representatives, what were you supposed to do in these other cities?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I, through local Police Department officials or law enforcement officials, made certain that the women who would gain access to the leader's suite were such that they would not be a security risk insofar as the national security of our government was concerned.
Mr. Madigan. Were these women that would not be a security risk be women who the Police Department had some relationship with?
Mr. Maheu. I don't know what you mean by relationship.

Mr. Madigan. You indicated in our discussion yesterday that the women that were allowed access to Leader "A" were to be women that the police would have some control over so that there would not be a possibility of a later blackmail problem with the United States government, is that correct?
Mr. Maheu. That is my recollection, yes.

Mr. Madigan. Do you participate in sending these women to the hotel where the leader was staying?
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall.
Mr. Madigan. Do you recall telling me yesterday that you did?
Mr. Maheu. No, I do not.
Mr. Madigan. Do you recall telling me yesterday when I asked you whether someone had travelled from city to city, you indicated that you thought maybe one did, but you weren't sure about how many others.
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.
Mr. Madigan. How many cities did you visit during the trip that this Leader "A" made?
Mr. Maheu. Several cities.
Mr. Madigan. Now were the women that were provided known to you or represented to you as prostitutes in any of these cities?

Mr. Madigan. According to your understanding, Mr. Maheu the project that you were involved in with the State Department in providing the women to this foreign leader in the various cities starting from New York and going through the other cities he stayed at, do you believe the women that were sent over to his hotel were prostitutes?
Mr. Maheu. That they may have been, yes.
Mr. Madigan. And you did participate under instructions from the government to send these women over to his hotel or make them available to him at his hotel, not knowing what happened after they got to the hotel?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.
Mr. Madigan. And that occurred in New York and the other cities that he stayed at while he was in the United States?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.
Mr. Madigan. And as far as these women travelling with you from city to city, your recollection is that one may have --

Mr. Maheu. No.
Mr. Madigan. But, you did not bring a crowd of six or seven.
Mr. Maheu. I have no recollection that any woman travelled with me, may have travelled independently, but I have no recollection of being on the same plane with any of these people.

Mr. Madigan. You think one may have traveled from city to city, or four or five?
Mr. Maheu. One may have gone to one further city. That is the best of my recollection.
Mr. Madigan. The others that were provided in each city were sort of local, so that they could be controlled, more or less, by the local police?
Mr. Maheu. That's my recollection.
Mr. Madigan. Is that the theory of the project?
Mr. Maheu. That's my recollection.

Mr. Madigan. Now with regard this same leader, did you ever receive an assignment from the CIA to produce any film with regard to him?
Mr. Maheu. Yes, I did.
Mr. Madigan. Do you remember when that assignment was in terms of whether it was before or after this visit to the United States?
Mr. Maheu. Subsequent to his visit to the United States

he made a trip to Russia. Our inputs were to the effect that he brought back from Russia with him an attractive, Russian agent, and that his philosophies related to the United States began to change appreciably and that the security of the United States was in great jeopardy as a result of whatever influence this female agent was able to have upon him.

Mr. Madigan. As a result of that, what assignment did you receive, if any, from the CIA?
Mr. Maheu. As a result, I was asked if -- well, as a result I was provided with pictures reflecting the quarters allegedly the quarters to which she was assigned during his trip to Russia, photographs of the female agent, and I was asked if I could find some contacts in Los Angeles who could produce a set resembling the headquarters reflected on the pictures, a woman who looked like the female agent, a male who looked like the leader, and take some pictures subsequently showing them together within the confines of the alleged headquarters.

Mr. Madigan. Did you recruit anybody to be in this film?
Mr. Maheu. Yes, I did.
Mr. Madigan. Who was that?
Mr. Maheu. I recruited a man who was working for me in Tucson, Arizona by the name of Charles Kays, a female agent who was known to -- I mean a female who was known to the law

Mr. Madigan. Did you ever advertise in the newspaper for that film?
Mr. Maheu. I have no recollection. I can't believe that where you would find the proper subjects, I don't believe so no.

Mr. Madigan. Did the CIA provide the set for this, did you do the backdrop to make it look like it was in Moscow?
Mr. Maheu. The CIA provided me with photographs and services of a person in Los Angeles who was in the industry on behalf of the CIA.
Mr. Madigan. Was that Bautzer?
Mr. Maheu. No, sir.
Mr. Madigan. Who was that?
Mr. Maheu. First I discussed the matter with Howard Hughes and he recommended that I contact Mr. Larry Crosby, which I did.

Mr. Madigan. Did Hughes have to approve your being involved in this?
Mr. Maheu. I am not sure he had to approve. I was just seeking his advice.
Mr. Madigan. You were more or less just telling him about it?

Mr. Madigan. Could this film have been described as a pornographic film, or was it something
Mr. Maheu. By today's technology, I would say definitely no.
Mr. Madigan. You say this woman was known to the law enforcement authorities. Was she suspected by yourself to be a prostitute?
Mr. Maheu. Not at all.

Mr. Maheu. Very short.
Mr. Madigan. Did you make any still photographs or anything like that?
Mr. Maheu. No, I did not.
Mr. Madigan. And then you turned the film over to the CIA?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.

Mr. Madigan. And thereafter do you know what happened to it?
Mr. Maheu. No, I do not.
Mr. Madigan. Were you told what was going to be done with it?
Mr. Maheu. I was told that the stills would be distributed in the country of the leader in an attempt to embarrass him and hopefully as a result remove what was considered to be a very serious threat to the national security of our country.

Mr. Madigan. Were you ever familiar with the project names that were attached to these assignments by the CIA?
Mr. Maheu. Not that I recollect, no.

Mr. Maheu. Yes, sir.
Mr. Madigan. What was your assignment in that regard?
Mr. Maheu. I was told that said leader would be visiting Los Angeles, that he was enthralled with Hollywood and asked if I could find someone to have a party, preferably in a private home, with a reasonably large attendance on his behalf to Los Angeles.
Mr. Madigan. And who did you contact with regard to that?
Mr. Maheu. I contacted Mr. Gregson Bautzer.

Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that the intent was to have starlets receiving him, my recollection but I do not recall that, for instance, one specific person was to be his date, if that's what you're implying.
Mr. Madigan. So your understanding was to have a number of people available at the party, that's all. Not to have anyone introduce one to him?
Mr. Maheu. To have the party, period.
Mr. Madigan. Not to introduce one to him?
Mr. Maheu. That is correct.
I did not go to the party, I do not know who all was there. I do recall that there were quite a few people present and again, my recollection is that since this particular leader was enthralled with Hollywood that the intent was to have present people with whom he would have an opportunity to converse concerning his interests in the movie industry, the making of movies, and talk to not only starlets, but I believe that some male stars were also invited to the party.
Mr. Madigan. As a result of the party, did the leader ingratiate himself with one particular female?
Mr. Maheu. I was subsequently told that as a result of having met a young starlet at the party, that they subsequently invited her to spend time with him in his country.
Mr. Madigan. Were you ever involved in providing a house or an island for him to stay at with this particular female?

Mr. Maheu. I have no recollection that I was asked.
Mr. Madigan. Do you know who that person was?
Mr. Maheu. I do not recall the name.
Mr. Madigan. You indicated that your recollection was that there was some embarrassment with regard to this female?
Mr. Maheu. I was subsequently told that at a subsequent date after the leader had taken this person with him to his country there was some embarrassment because it turned out that the leader was from an Arabic country and the young starlet was of Jewish extraction.

Mr. Madigan. Was your assignment in that regard solely to set up the one party, was that the end of it?
Mr. Maheu. That is my recollection of it, yes.
Mr. Madigan. Did you have any other assignments with regard to that Leader "B"?
Mr. Maheu. I have no recollection.
Mr. Madigan. Did you have any other assignments with regard to Leader "A"?
Mr. Maheu. I have no recollection that I did.
Mr. Madigan. Did you undertake any other Agency assignments with regard to any other leader of any other country?
