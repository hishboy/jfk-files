A. OPERATIONAL

1. During the period under review, financial support to the AMSPELL organization has been reduced significantly. As reported in references, the primary reason for the reduction was the inconsistencies of many AMSPELL activities with current WOFACT directives.

2. Cooperation between AMSPELL and the Station has been maintained through AMHINT-2, the principal agent of the AMSPELL operation. Although no longer being carried on a salaried basis, AMHINT-2 has continued to be responsive to Station guidance.

3. AMSPELL has continued its correspondence with various student groups and leaders throughout the free world, and especially in Latin America. AMSPELL has contacted various international student groups requesting passage money so that its delegates could be afforded the opportunity to attend upcoming international student conferences.

4. A campaign was launched to call attention to the plight of Pedro Luis BOITEL, a Cuban student leader who was unjustly imprisoned on the Isle of Pines by the CASTRO regime. A report/denunciation of the imprisonment of BOITEL was prepared and sent to AMSPELL's principal contacts in the Latin American student field seeking support for AMSPELL's demand that BOITEL be released.

B. PRODUCTION

1. AMSPELL bi-monthly magazine (copy being forwarded under separate cover)

a. AMSPELL efforts during recent months have been mainly concentrated on the preparation of its new bi-monthly magazine. 8,000 copies of the magazine's first edition which was published in May 1966 were distributed as follows:

(1) 3,000 copies sent to Latin America
(2) 1,100 copies distributed by AMSPELL delegations
(3) 3,000 copies distributed among Cubans in the United States
(4) 100 copies were sent to AMSPELL contacts and student movements in Europe, Africa, Asia, Canada, etc.
(5) Members of the AMSPELL organization also received copies in which the AMSPELL internal bulletin was inserted. Each member was asked to promote the sale of subscriptions and advertising space as well as to seek persons who would collaborate with the magazine staff by contributing their talents.
(6) The remainder was distributed among the various embassies, official representations of governments and organizations, both in the United States and abroad, as well as among Cuban exile journalists and organizations.

2. AMSPELL Cuban mailing

Since March 1966, 1,000 envelopes containing AMSPELL propaganda have been mailed to Cuba on a monthly basis. This propaganda is directed particularly at students who support the regime (copies of the propaganda are being forwarded under separate cover).

3. Press

The majority of AMSPELL press releases have been in connection with the mistreatment of political prisoners by the Castro regime. Other releases concerned the aforementioned BOITEL campaign and a tribute to Cuban martyrs who gave their lives fighting against the BATISTA dictatorship in 1957. (Copies of the press releases are being forwarded under separate cover.)

C. FINANCIAL

1. Final payment of AMSPELL salaries and termination bonuses was made in February in line with the Station's reduction of financial support to AMSPELL. Under the present arrangement JMWAVE support is limited to $1,600 monthly, this includes the $200 monthly financial support payment to AMHINT-1's family, office overhead, and support for printing/distributing the bi-monthly publication.

2. The following amounts were expended by the Station in support of AMSPELL activities during the second half of FY 66:

Operational expenses ................. $ 9,929.74
Salaries and termination bonuses ..... 6,200.00
Total expenditures ..... $16,129.74

D. FUTURE PLANS

It is anticipated that AMSPELL efforts in the near future will be directed at the upcoming CLAE meeting which is scheduled to be held in Havana 29 July to 9 August 1966.

1. General

During the period under review, AMHINT/2 visited Caracas and turned in a report on the university situation in that country which was submitted in Reference. In addition to the normal propaganda activities, the AMSPELL group waged a campaign for the release of political prisoners and has intensified this campaign since the announcement of the "open door" policy on 28 September 1965.

2. Propaganda Production (samples forwarded under separate cover)

a. 4,800 copies of the bulletin were mailed into PBRUMEN each month. Over 6,000 copies of the international edition were sent monthly to addressees in Latin America and Western Europe. Among the main issues treated in the bulletins were: internal problems of PBRUMEN communism as a result of Ben Bella's overthrow; communist atrocities in Viet Nam; testimony of Alberto Muller on the secret executions in Communist PBRUMEN; the comments of Identity A with respect to the PBRUMEN situation, the exodus and Che Guevara's disappearance.

b. Miscellaneous press clippings and press releases are also forwarded under separate cover. Included is an article by AMHINT/2 on the student discontent in PBRUMEN which appeared in Identity B. Other articles and press releases were used by Identities B, C and D and by AMHIM.
