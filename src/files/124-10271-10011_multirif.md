Memorandum
TO: Mr. J. B. Adams
FROM: Legal Counsel
SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
DATE: 6/2/75
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1-11-01 BY SPALMIRY

At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held
with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.
Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me.

Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select
Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney
General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were
presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be
furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal
memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff request
the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative
the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROS.

Upon our return to the Bureau, Mr. Adams requested that the
Intelligence Division undertake an analysis of each of the summaries which
were attached to the Petersen report in order to make a damage assessment
based on factors that would affect current Bureau operations should they be
revealed to the Committee. He also requested that this information be
compiled and available to brief the Deputy Attorney General as to the
difficulties that would be involved upon disclosure.

SUBJECT: CLEARANCE OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY
THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL INTELLIGENCE CONFERENCE
(IIC) FOR RELEASE TO THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
The following is to record the clearance of
certain documents prepared by the IIC and, in some instances,
the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (ICIS)
for release to the Senate Select Committee (SSC).
The SSC has been furnished a paper prepared by
the Intelligence Division which was a position paper on
the FBI's jurisdiction in internal security matters,
intelligence and counterintelligence investigations. This
paper was dated 2/13/75 and set forth information taken
from certain documents or parts of documents by the IIC
and, in some instances, the ICIS. All of these documents
have been cleared for passage to the SSC by the following
members of the IIC, as well as Mr. William Wark, Executive
Secretary of the ICIS:
Mr. Rowland Morrow, Director, Defense
Investigative Programs Office; Mr. Merrill
Kelly, Deputy Director of Operations, ACSI,
U. S. Army; Colonel Leo Olsen, OSI, U. S.
Air Force; Mr. Jack Donnelly, Naval Investi-
gative Service.
Mr. Wark advised he did not feel it necessary
to clear documents through the Attorney General since they
pertain to IIC matters which were merely concurred in by
ICIS.
Copies of the documents involved are attached and
are as follows:

NOTE:
The Senate Select Committee has expressed an urgent
interest in the details of any FBI investigation concerning the
disappearance of Thomas Riha, former Professor at University of
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, in March, 1969. The Bureau con-
ducted no investigation regarding the disappearance. There was
considerable publicity with reference to a statement made by
Dr. Smiley, then President of the university, that he had been
informed by a Government official that Riha "was alive and well"
Smiley was interviewed by the El Paso Office. Smiley furnished
information in the strictest of confidence, not to be dissemin-
ated to any outside agency, regarding his contacts with a CIA
representative in Boulder after the Riha disappearance. It was
the CIA official who told him that Riha was alive and well.
Without the Smiley interview our response to the Senate Select
Committee has an obvious gap. If the Committee calls any wit-
nesses in the Riha matter Dr. Smiley would be one of the most
logical persons to call. The passage of time and other factors
may have brought about a change in the mind of Dr. Smiley
regarding the necessity to keep the information furnished by him,
in a confidential relationship with the Bureau and it is
believed he should be given the opportunity to either reinforce
his request for confidentiality or release the Bureau from the
restriction he imposed.

Re:
INTERVIEW OF RETIRED SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
BY SENATOR WALTER F. MONDALE AND
STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE (SSC)
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1-19-01 BY SPALMIRU
Set out below is information voluntarily furnished
to the FBI by retired SA John P. Devlin following his voluntary
appearance before Senator Mondale and Staff Members of the
Senate Select Committee on May 19, 1975. Devlin's appearance
followed an interview of him by Senate Select Committee Staff
Member Michael T. Epstein on April 25, 1975. A memorandum
reporting the results of the April 25, 1975, interview was for-
warded to the Attorney General as an enclosure to my letter to
the Attorney General dated May 8, 1975, entitled "United States
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities."
On May 19, 1975, Devlin was interviewed by Senator
Mondale; SSC Chief Counsel Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr.;
Assistant Minority Counsel Charles Kirbow; and Epstein. The
interview was conducted in a building across the street from
the Dirksen Building in Washington, D. C., and lasted from
approximately 2:00 p.m. to 3:20 p.m. Devlin was not subpoenaed
to appear but appeared voluntarily. He was placed under oath
by Senator Mondale.
At the outset of the interview Devlin was advised of
his rights: that he could be represented by counsel and that
if he had none, but desired counsel, the Committee Staff would
attempt to provide one for him. At the conclusion of the inter-
view he was thanked but given no indication as to whether he
would be called to testify before the SSC.

Re:
Interview of Retired Special Agent (SA)
by Senator Walter F. Mondale and
Staff Members of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC)
Following being advised of his rights, Devlin
was asked who sent him to Atlantic City and why he was sent.
He advised he received his instructions from Special Agent in
Charge Ralph Bachman through Devlin's supervisor, SA Vincent
Murphy. It is to be noted here that upon being interviewed by
Epstein on April 25, 1975, Devlin had indicated he had received
his instructions through his supervisor, SA William Gagnon.
Devlin corrected this mistake during the interview of May 19,
1975. As to
