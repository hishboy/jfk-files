Dear Friend,

Merry Christmas!

I regret that it has taken this long to settle the matter of your letter of September 22, 1968, but better late than never, I guess. Although your efforts in our behalf with Hank were not successful, we do appreciate the fact that you and your wife went out of your way to try to help us.

I referred the matter of your late moving bill to the appropriate individual. Unfortunately, this bill was received too late, as all your accounts had been settled. He has asked me to extend his regrets on this matter.

Please accept my best wishes for a Joyous Christmas and the hope that 1969 will indeed be a good year for you and yours.

Sincerely,

Gale

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum dated 26 September 1968

In the reference you stated that DO will send FAZZARE sterile check for his expenses incurred in his efforts to persuade TICHBORN's wife to agree to an assignment in Spain. You also forwarded a bill which FAZZARE sent for additional freight expenses from Madrid for which he has not been reimbursed.

EUR does not wish to reimburse FAZZARE for this claim. When he resigned from the Agency he submitted his final accounting and signed a Quit-Claim for all expenses. In his note to you, a copy of which you forwarded with reference, he asked that you forward his bill "to the Spanish Section for reimbursement if not too late... We would appreciate it if you could send FAZZARE a note when you forward his sterile check and state that we are sorry but this final accounting has been completed, that the books have been cleared, and that it is indeed too late to authorize additional funds.

MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

SUBJECT: Project WUBRINY Termination Settlement with Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

The undersigned on 12 September 1968 went to New York to effect a termination settlement with Edward G. TICHBORN (P). A hotel room at the Shoreham Hotel, 33 West 55th Street, was obtained for a meeting place. There were two principal aspects to the settlement:

1. Secure TICHBORN's acceptance of an amendment to his contract providing for a one-time lump sum taxable payment of $3311.00 and releasing the U.S. Government from any further claim and,

2. Insure that TICHBORN had, as of 31 August 1968, administratively severed his relationship with WUSALINE, particularly that his accountings for expenses incurred in 1968 were submitted, recorded by WUSALINE, and certified correct and proper by both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11.

The first part of the settlement went smoothly. TICHBORN on 12 September 1968 readily accepted the amendment to his basic contract. He brought along for the Covert Tax Unit a copy of his 1966 income tax return which the undersigned had stipulated as a requirement for settlement. He was given his one-time lump sum taxable payment of $3311 in two checks ($2833.62 and $477.38) drawn on a DO proprietary company (WUTACTIC) which will issue TICHBORN a Form 1099 for income tax filing. He readily endorsed and gave to the undersigned the check for $477.38 in settlement of the amount he owed WH Division from his tour in Mexico City.

Through no fault of TICHBORN, the administrative severance from WUSALINE did not go as smoothly. In spite of several request by both TICHBORN and the undersigned,

WUBRINY/11 did not have ready a list of expenses incurred by TICHBORN in 1968 for checking by the undersigned and certification by TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11. WUBRINY/11 telephoned to say that his accountant was unable to locate some of TICHBORN's accountings. The undersigned then requested WUBRINY/11 to join him and TICHBORN. The undersigned had a partial list of TICHBORN's expenses previously submitted by WUBRINY/11. The undersigned enjoined TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to prepare a complete list of expenses for 1968. TICHBORN was asked to record the purpose of each expense. The undersigned emphasized in WUBRINY/11's presence that TICHBORN should ensure that no expenses chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm were charged to WUSALINE. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 were reminded that all expenses on the Venezuela project were chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm as well as one-half of the expenses on the Mexican Border project. TICHBORN said that he would get all of the accountings from WUBRINY/11's comptroller to determine which, if any, accountings were missing and, as requested, to note the purpose of the expenses. It was agreed to meet the following morning of September 13, 1968 on this matter.

On the morning of September 13, 1968, TICHBORN telephoned the undersigned to say that he was able from his records to supply the missing data. He also said that notations on the records obtained from the comptroller showed that he had, in fact, submitted the accountings that were missing. TICHBORN concluded from this that WUBRINY/1's private firm had lost the missing accountings. TICHBORN also said that a few of the charges on the partial list of expenses which the undersigned had given him to review should have been charged to WUBRINY/1's private firm. The undersigned then requested TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to meet with him at noon so that the undersigned could review the accountings and obtain certifications from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11. Both agreed to the meeting. Subsequently, TICHBORN telephoned to say that he and WUBRINY/11 were all set to come to the undersigned's hotel when the unwitting comptroller took all the financial statements to review them again. TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 were in no position to retain the statements and thus could not meet as scheduled. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 agreed that the accountings were now in order. The undersigned again informed TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 by phone that each must certify that the expenses were proper charges to WUSALINE. WUBRINY/11 was instructed to mail the list to the undersigned as soon as possible.

SECRET

Certain other administrative matters were taken up with TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 during the afternoon of 12 September 1963. The undersigned secured agreement from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 that TICHBORN's services on WUBRINY/1's Venezuela project were as great as any other officer who worked on it and that, therefore, WUSALINE should receive for TICHBORN's services on this project compensation at least equal to that given any officer in WUBRINY/1's private firm. The undersigned obtained from TICHBORN the two credit cards (American Express and Pan American air travel card) issued to him under WUSALINE sponsorship. The undersigned asked TICHBORN if he had charged any expenses under these cards since 31 August 1968. TICHBORN said that he had entertained a movie producer who visited him as an outgrowth of his trip to California to develop a movie adjunct to his cover. For this reason, TICHBORN opined that the Agency should pay for the expense. The undersigned said that TICHBORN was not authorized to incur any further expenses after 31 August 1968. TICHBORN then readily agreed to pay the expense

There is a possibility that WH Division may want TICHBORN to take an operational TDY in Chile. TICHBORN was alerted to this possibility. He expressed interest in the assignment, but pointed out that he now has to get a job and that, consequently, his availability will depend upon his job situation.

TICHBORN was extremely friendly and cooperative and the settlement was amicably effected.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

SUBJECT: Project BUTACTIC Funding Through WUGAP

Tichborn 201

On Monday afternoon, the undersigned was requested by Mr. Gale Allen, DO/CO, to provide a mechanism for funding $3,311.00 to an Agent he was terminating (Edward G. TICHBORN (P). Mr. Allen is traveling to New York on Thursday, 12 September 1968 and would like to pay the termination bonus to TICHBORN at that time. Prior to our discussion, Mr. Allen had arranged for the funds to be paid by sterile check, but Mr. Randall, DO/BF suggested that he consult DO/CH for a funding mechanism in order to insure proper tax reporting for TICHBORN.

Mr. Allen explained to the undersigned that TICHBORN had been employed, until his termination, by one of the Project WUBRINY entities. Apparently, there is an unwitting Comptroller in the WUBRINY entity and there was no reasonable story that could be offered to explain the $3,311.00 termination bonus. Therefore, it is necessary to use another entity that can provide a Form 1099 for tax purposes.

Since WUGAP has sufficient funds in its bank account to manage a $3,311.00 disbursement, it was decided to utilize this company. Mr. Allen was advised to stop the sterile check process and to have the $3,311.00 voucher approved and forwarded to DO/CM for payment instructions. At that time, the undersigned will prepare a Request for Advance of Funds (WUTACTIC) in the amount of $689.00 and Payment Instructions for $4,000.00 ($3,311.00 plus $689.00). This procedure is being followed in order that WUGAP can show the exact same amount of money being received and disbursed.

MEMO TO : AG

FROM : LH

IN RE : Meetings with MT re Spain

Given to by Gale Allen (DODS)

(R) TICHBORN

1. Had several long conversations with FAZZARE on 18 July 60 regarding various aspects of potential assignment in Spain:

a) long confab over two drinks after Joint session Wednesday afternoon,

b) shorter talk on plane ride

c) extended conversation on Thursday evening, when we had dinner with our respective spouses 6:30 PM to 2:00 AM.

Our many hours together (with and without our wives) produced two principal conclusions:

1. Reinforced my wife's objections to moving to Spain, also convincing me that it would be prejudicial for my children.

2. Convinced me that even if no family objections to moving, it would be unwise to establish permanent residence in Spain because of the security risks involved therein. Both and I feel that several in-and-out trips would accomplish our purposes without running the risk of appearing implausible in that traditionally-suspicious country.
