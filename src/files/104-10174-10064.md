MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, B/DB/S, Richard Long
No. 201-253203

Operational Approval is hereby granted in the case of LOPEZ, Henry P. for the purpose specified in your request dated as follows:

Operational Approval is granted for the use of Subject in Spain (a) to identify, cultivate, and acquire intelligence from those individuals and groups within Spain who now play, and can be expected to play in the post-Franco period, a significant role in determining Spanish domestic and foreign policy, and to spot and assess individuals within the above group for possible recruitment by other Station assets, specifically as set forth in paragraph 3 of the memorandum dated 3 June 1968 addressed to CI/CA by AC/E/IB. No other use authorized.

It is understood that Subject himself will not attempt recruitments nor will he be required to break his cover.

In view of his background, it is recommended that caution be exercised in dealing with Subject.

This cancels and supersedes all previous approvals.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief/E/IB/S

SUBJECT: Project WUBRINY Possible Operational Support of Madrid Station Objectives by Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

REFERENCE: OSMA 23, 350 Dated 11 January 1968

1. Per Mr. Long's request, the undersigned on 30 January 1968 discussed with Edward G. TICHBORN (P) possible support of Madrid Station objectives as raised in ref. It was confirmed that:

a. WUSALINE/Iberia can be used as an information collection mechanism in cases where information requirements can be couched in plausible economic and commercial terms for contractual surveys.

b. TICHBORN can assess and develop selected Spanish contacts of Madrid Station who may be visiting New York and who desire introductions in US commercial circles.

c. TICHBORN can develop Spaniards in New York as may be of operational interest to the Madrid Station. TICHBORN has not made effort to develop Spaniards in New York but is willing and able to do so for any designated as operational targets. If desired, TICHBORN thinks he can meet the Spanish Ambassador to the U. S. through a friend, Senator Jose Montoya of New Mexico.

d. TICHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for publishing in a prominent publication, such as "Life International." TICHBORN believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because he previously published in "Life International" a four-page spread on birth control in Latin America. This article was favorably reviewed. TICHBORN suggested a related article on the population explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen, TICHBORN,

14-00000

as a result of journalistic collaboration with Katherine Anne Porter, is represented in New York by a top-terary agent, Monica McCall. TICHBORN thinks that it would take him two to three weeks in Spain interviewing top Spanish industrialists and bankers. He would send letters in advance to these targets informing them of his proposed itinerary, the purpose of his trip, and enclosing copies of his previous articles with favorable reviewer comments. He could be essentially a free lance journalist or have a business purpose as well. In the latter connection, it is of interest that following TICHBORN's trip to Spain, WUBRINY/1 sent a geologist to WUSALINE/Iberia to look into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely commercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN's trip and thus enhances TICHBORN's commercial bonafides.

2. It is understood that E/IB/S has a copy of TICHBORN's report for dispatch to the Madrid Station per ref.

3. Personnel concerned with Project WUBRINY will be glad to work with E/IB/S in any follow-up to the possibilities noted above.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, EUR Division

ATTENTION Chief, E/IB

SUBJECT DO 66-264 5000 774-56 Possible Exploitation of ICAP Iberia, S.A.

1. Reference is made to the meeting on subject with Mr. Osborne Day, DCOS/Madrid, Mr. Stephen Munger, DC/E/IB, and Mr. Gale Allen of DOCO just prior to Mr. Day's departure for Madrid. It is recalled that Mr. Allen agreed to pass the most recent information on ICAP Iberia, S.A. to E/Is for transmittal to Mr. Day in Madrid. Mr. Day would review this information together with that known to the station and determine if the firm has an operational potential for the Madrid Station. In the event of an affirmative determination, Mr. Day indicated that he would be interested in the assignment to ICAP Iberia or a DO career commercial operations officer who would be carried on the DO t/o but would be assigned operational tasks by the Madrid Station.

2. ICAP Iberia, S.A. (see brochure attached as Tab A) is joint venture company formed by a DO proprietary company, ICAP Corporation, New York, and the Spanish Corporation banif S.A. It is domiciled in the Banif offices at Juan Bravo 2, Madrid, Spain, and currently has no staff. Two of the Banif Directors, Miguel Echegaray and Juan Antonio Ruiz de Alda, concern themselves with ICAP matters on a day to day basis when required. ICAP Iberia serves mainly as the clearing house for Banif business requiring support by ICAP New York and for ICAP business requiring support by Bani in Spain. Recently in a letter dated 4 October 1966 the President of Banif, Juan A. Ruiz de Alda, suggested to the President of ICAP Corporation that a man and secretary be to ICAP Iberia to "keep issues alive, look for new ones, and obtain the backing of our organizations for the completion of the work to be done." The stage thus appears to be set in WOFACT should desire to assign an officer to ICAP Iberia, S.A.

SECRET

SECRET

The operational potential of ICAP Iberia, S.A., other than non-official commercial cover, must necessarily depend upon the activities, personnel, and contacts of Banif. As may be noted in the descriptive note on Banif attached as Tab B, the activities of Banif include research, consulting, securities, new business, underwriting, and investment. These activities cut across most aspects of economic and political life in Spain. Banif's personnel have impressive backgrounds and its clients and references are of a very high level.

4. Attached as Tab C are three additional pamphlets on Banif covering its research and study department, its financial services, and its investment bulletin.

5. DO would appreciate your comments on assigning a WOFACT officer to ICAP Iberia, S.A. Normally, when a DC commercial mechanism provides a cover opportunity, the Area Division supplies the officer to be assigned. DO would, of course, welcome such an assignment in this case. DO, in coordination with AR, would also be willing to consider a suitable career trainee for assignment DO and thence to ICAP Iberia, S.A. as part of Do's development of career commercial operations officers. Mr. Allen of DOCO, Code 11, Extention 62888, may be contacted for ther information on this matter.

DATE: 8 November 1966

FROM Chief, DO Division

SUBJECT: Information about Spain (and Portugal)

1. I have a request which seems to me to be right up the alley of your friend, WUBRINY/1. I would hope, therefore, that he will try to do us a fairly rapid and yet analytic job.

2. The request is for as accurate information as possible on the following questions:

a. What or who, or both, represent the most significant power elements in the economic or commercial field in Spain today? Wherever possible, even in the cases where potent companies have been named, specific individuals having the positions of authority should be identified. In addition, wherever possible, relationships between these individuals and American interests whether a company or another individual should be specified.

b. What American interests, corporate or personal, have major investments or holdings in Spain? What are the nature of their investments or holdings and who are the individuals basically responsible?

c. To the extent possible, provide the same answers as requested above for Portugal. Since Spain is of greater interest, this question should only be answered to the extent possible without too great an expenditure of time. If on the other hand it is felt that good answers can be provided with regard to Portugal given extra time, I would suggest that the Spanish answers be submitted as soon as possible and the Portuguese information given at a later date.

3. I would appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as possible WUBRINY/I's reaction to the above requests - can he get the answers; will they be in considerable detail and how long does he think that it will take?

P.S. It is assumed that, if it is possible to do it at all, the above request can be carried out without stirring a lot of curiosity and consequent inquiry.

Encuesta Mundial

Henry P. López o la Votación Mexicana en los Estados Unidos

Por CARLOS DENEGRI, VII-LOS ANGELES

¿Qué decir de la influencia de Mexico y de su cultura en los Estados Unidos?

"Por favor —dice el abogado Henry P. Lopez—, note usted la acertada sensibilidad politica del Presidente Kennedy, y tendremos una primera respuesta a su pregunta. Kennedy ha escogido a un mexicano de origen, ciudadano norteamericane claro está, Ramon Tellez, ex alcalde de El Paso, come embajador de los Estados Unidos en Costa Rica... Otro mexicano, de origen, ha sido designado para dirigir el juzgado de distrito del Sur de Texas. El caso de Enrique Gonzalez, abogado de San Antonio, es un ejemplo mas...

Pero, ¿quién es Henry P. Lopez... Nos lo presenta J. Carlos McCormick, ayudante especial del subsecretario auxiliar adjunto de Asuntos Interamericanos, del Departamento de Estado en Washington: “De ascendencia mexicana, el abogado estadunidense Henry P. López ha logrado una brillante carrera como internacionalista y miembro prominente del Partido Demócrata de California, Graduado en Harvard, miembro de la eminente fraternidad "Phi Beta Kappa", fue el triunfador en el concurso nacional de oratoria de 1942. Candidato de eu partido, en 1958, para el cargo de secretario de Estado del Gobierno de California, obtuvo una de las más altas votaciones estatales.

Declaración histórica.

En California, por ejemplo, el voto potencial del Estado --me refiero al de filiación mexicana de origen, es de un millón trescientos mil. En Texas, de doscientos cincuenta mil. En Nuevo Mexico, cerca del cincuenta por ciento del electorado es de origen mexicano".

La mayoría de estos votantes son democratas. Interés pues, del Partido en el poder, en Estados Unidos, es el de cuidar de cerca, alentar y encauzer a esos millones de hispanoamericanos, como los aman en el vecino país.

"Por eso fue que en la campaña de 1980, por primera vez en la historia, sé crearon hataliones especiales de mexicanos de origen que, al grito de "Viva" Ken-ned asaltaron rivicamente las casas electorales, dando el triunfo at de Nueva Inglaterra

"Baste haber viajado por la parte sur del país, para que hasta el mas superficial observador reconozca, de inmediato, la influencia de México. En la arquitectura, en la música, en la alimentación en los nombres españoles de las ciudades; en la misma composición etnica del pueblo".

El abogado Henry P. López, enumera, en seguida, los diversos capitulos de lo que él considera la influencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos.

"Lo que respecta a la arquitectura. México ha fija-do la imagen de su pasado colonial en incontables edifi-cios, plazas, santuarios y hasta en poblados enteros Texas. California. Nuevo México, Colorado. Y aun en la misma ciudad imperial de Nueva York. Hay lugares como Santa Barbara y Monterrey, en California, capa-ces de evocar tan exquisito sabor hispanico, que adie puede substraerse a la nostalgia que todo ello produce. Pero no toda la influencia arquitectural de Mexico en los Estados Unidos es colonial. La moderna arquitectura, también tiene toques de mexicanidad.

Este excelente arquitecto, ejerce una extraordinaria influencia en la arquitectura moderna de Estados Unidos. en general, en todas las manifestaciones artísticas estéticas.

Subject has recently solved his foremost personal problems the shipment of his personal furniture into Mexico. The cost of the shipment was considerably less than the amount authorized by Headquarters.

.2. Subject shows signs of being a valuable asset to the Station. He will be assigned to take over as a temporary replacement for RIKON when the latter is on home leave over the holidays. He very probably will maintain contact with the new student president on RIKCN's return so that the Station will be able to utilize TICHPORN's knowledge of election techniques in the next student elections at National University.

3. Generally, TICHBORN will be used by the Station as outside case officer for operations in the intellectual field. He has already made contacts in the theatre, ballet, film, writing and student spheres. In order to increase his wility to meet and cultivate assets, the Station is authorizing TICHBORN the rental of a small apartment, to be sparsely furnished in a bohemian manner. Subject is posing as a left-of-center Mexican-American, and will provide the Station with regular reports on personalities and activities in the intellectual field, as well as run operations at Station direction.

CROFILM

The Station will recall that part of Edward G. Tichborn's cover is provided by DTEMFARGO. Before leaving for Mexico, ho met Staff Agent Michael Skirman (p) and was told to develop a relationship with with DTEMBARGO and Skirman through correspondence. It was suggested that he might submit an occasional article for consideration by JHWOOL (Identity 6 of reference). Tichborn has submitted his first article. While possibly suitable for publication in certain kinds of magazines ("The New Leader", "The Reporter", or The Saturday Review"), it is not suitable for JMWOOL since it is a journalistic think-piece and not a scholarly effort and it is by and large critical of The Alianza para el Progreso and the United States role in The Alianza and in Latin America in general.

3. It is therefore requested that Station explain to Tichborn, if he brings this matter up, that JMWOOL is designed to support and foster United States policies in Latin America and not gratuitously to criticize them, regardless of the purpose of the criticism.

Although the sweet sound of 20 billion dollars created a momentary euphoria at the Punta del Este conference several weeks ago, it is now obvious that President Kennedy's prodigious "Alianza para el Progreso" faces a difficult uncertain future.

The delegates had scarcely returned home when the Goulart-Brazilian crisis erupted and thereby threatened the very beginnings of Kennedy's hopeful proposal. And certainly no seasoned observer of Latin American politics can assume that the Brazilian cries has been resolved by the quickly-devised modus operandi which permitted Joao Goulart to assume the presidency. Goulart insisted the constitutional amendment limiting his powers be submitted to Brazilian voters in a referendum, clearly indicating he will not be content with a mere figurehead states. With the conservative militarists still adamant in their opposition to a fully-powered Goulart, a civil war (a prolonged and bloody one) may be in the offing. Meanwhile, the creators of the Alliance for Progress find themselves in a watchful, hopeful dither.

But, aside from the Brazilian problem, the Allangs already had and still has a number of formidable obstacles which were readily observable from the outset. Fully granting the immense possibilities offered by this economic Magna Carta for the Americae, it would be foolish to overlook or to minimize those sasie harah realities of which dreams are not made.

Among the toughest realities facing the Alliance is the Congress of the United States, which has always been reluctant to approve long-range

14-00000

foreign aid. Even before the U. S. delegation had returned to Washington, Senator Thruston Morton grumplly informed the press that the Republican Party would have no part of Dillon's wild schemes. Then, in a week of now-you-have-it-now-you-don't bickering in the House and Senate, the Alliance spenders were given to understand that the carte is not quita blanche as they might hops,

Even assuming a more generous Congressional attitude toward long-range financing rather than year-to-year appropriations, some observers were inclined to skepticism in re Treasury Secretary Dilica's implied promise of 20 billion dollars over a ten-year period. Answering the skeptics, Dillon assured the Punta del Este delegates that a large ahare of the 20 billion would come from auch already-established and soon-to-be-expanded agencies as the Export-Import Bank, Development Loan Fund, the World Bank, the International Cooperation Administration, International Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank. He also expects increased Investment by private entities. But, notwithstanding such assgurances, certala financial experts view Dillon's figures as overly optimistic. They point cat, for example, that Dillon's expectation of 300 million dollars from the World Bank is unrealistic in view of the fact that it extended only 148 million dollars in credits to Latin America in 1960.

As for Secretary Dillon's expectations for increased investments and loans from private sources, the skeptics would appear to have even greater
