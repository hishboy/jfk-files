My memorandum of 9/14/67 set forth for the Director's information data concerning antipoverty workers' involvement in racial disturbances for his possible use at the forthcoming luncheon conference mentioned above.

The following additional information received from the Dallas Office today is being submitted for the Director's consideration in connection with this luncheon.

In response to a request from Mr. Randolf Ratliff, a Director of the Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty in Dallas, Texas, a representative of this Bureau explained the FBI's jurisdiction in racial matters to members of Ratliff's staff, who work in the poverty areas in Dallas County Texas, on 9/6/67. The Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty is funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

On 9/13/67 one of Ratliff's staff workers confidentially advised that after our representative had left the above meeting, Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no information and said that the FBI is the white man's police and they want nothing but "stool pigeons." This individual further alleged that all of Ratliff's staff members were hand-picked by Ratliff and that most of them are racial agitators. He charged that Ratliff and most of the staff members are working at creating racial incidents in order to stir up local Negro communities.

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

RE: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY
DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and antipolice. He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional antipoverty funds.

The source of the above information also alleged that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity learned of his activity and told him to desist. He stated that in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic), staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot. He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action. Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb an "Uncle Tom."

The above information is being made available to Mrs. Stegall at the White House, Mr. Shriver of the Office of Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated 9/18/67.

ACTION:

Submitted for the Director's possible use.

Director, FBI (65-63113) PERSONAL ATTENTION

INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE OF DIPLOMATIC
REPRESENTATIVES OF FRIENDLY FOREIGN NATIONS

As you are aware, at the present time our coverage on the intelligence efforts of foreign countries here in the United States is primarily aimed at the activities of Soviet and Communist bloc countries. This has been brought about by the fact that those countries represent the greatest threat to the security of our nation, both in the international and domestic fields.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a number of instances have been brought to our attention reflecting so-called "friendly nations" are engaging in direct intelligence activities against the United States. The case involving Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., who was engaged in furnishing top secret information from the National Security Agency to representatives of the Netherlands Government, fully portrays the inherent danger in such intelligence activities. Once vital information reaches another nation, our security with respect to such information is only as good as the security of the foreign government.

The purpose of this memorandum, therefore, is to alert you to the necessity of promptly bringing to the Bureau's attention any information developed indicating representatives of foreign countries are engaged in intelligence activities here. Our basic policy is to conduct investigations only in instances where we receive allegations indicating an individual representing a foreign nation is engaging in activities in violation of our laws or otherwise constitutes a security menace.

The Bureau is aware that the French, the British, the Israelis, the Germans, and a number of other nations either have regularly assigned intelligence representatives in the United States or, from time to time, send such representatives to the United States. In many instances such representatives deal with United States Government agencies on an official basis. At the same time, it is possible that such representatives are engaged in other intelligence activities while here. We are requesting other Government agencies who deal with intelligence representatives of foreign governments to keep us advised of the identities of foreign intelligence representatives in the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is incumbent upon us to be alert to develop information on foreign intelligence representatives and to exploit any situation which may develop indicating such persons are endangering United States security.

This Bureau has received information in a number of instances in the recent past where representatives of so-called "friendly nations" have engaged in intelligence activities in violation of existing United States statutes and against the best interests of the United States. The case involving Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., wherein vital information from the National Security Agency was furnished to representatives of the Netherlands Government, illustrates the security menace to the United States Government in such activities.

We are aware of the identity of certain intelligence representatives of friendly countries who are stationed in the United States. We are aware that certain of these representatives officially represent their governments in dealing with agencies of the United States Government. In other instances, it has come to our attention that intelligence representatives of foreign governments make visits to the United States to confer with United States agencies. Frequently, however, we are not officially notified when such individuals come to the United States as intelligence representatives and, while other United States agencies are probably officially sponsoring the visits of such representatives, the possibility remains that such persons may, while in the United States, engage in intelligence missions which are not known to the United States agency sponsoring the visit.

We would, therefore, like to be notified by the recipients of this letter when information is received that an intelligence representative of a foreign government is coming to the United States. We would like to be advised in the event any agency sets up a liaison arrangement with such an intelligence representative and to be furnished with brief details of his approved activity. This information is needed in order to guide this Bureau in discharging its responsibilities and, at the same time, it will enable us to advise the appropriate agency in the event information is received that the intelligence representative is acting outside the scope of his approved activity. Similarly, any information concerning the activities of these intelligence representatives coming to the attention of any agency which would appear to be outside the scope of their prescribed activity should be brought to the attention of this Bureau. These data will assist us in eliminating unnecessary inquiries and in concentrating on those matters of this type which merit close attention.

We would like to have this information with respect to intelligence representatives now in the United States and, on a continuing basis, with respect to future arrivals. Of course, we desire to continue to be furnished data concerning suspected intelligence representatives who arrive and with whom no working arrangement exists.

The above request is also being directed separately to the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Department of the Army; the Director of Naval Intelligence, Department of the Navy; the Director of Special Investigations, the Inspector General, Department of the Air Force, and the National Security Agency.

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE OF DIPLOMATIC
REPRESENTATIVES OF FRIENDLY FOREIGN NATIONS

Attached hereto is a copy of a letter to
Mr. Dennis A. Flinn, Director, Office of Security, Department
of State, Washington, D. C., in which there is being set
forth the request that other agencies of the United States
Government notify this Bureau when they have knowledge of the
identities of intelligence representatives of so-called
"friendly foreign nations" who are in the United States.

It was thought you would be interested in this as
intelligence activities aimed against the United States,
regardless of the country from which they emanate, do
constitute a security hazard.

You will note from the attached letter that this
request is also being directed to the Director, Central
Intelligence Agency; the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2,
Department of the Army; the Director of Naval Intelligence,
Department of the Navy; the Director of Special Investigations,
the Inspector General, Department of the Air Force, and the

Dear Mr. Hoover:

Reference is made to your letter dated 18 November 1954,
Subject: Intelligence Coverage of Diplomatic Representatives of
Friendly Foreign Nations.

For your interim information, preliminary study of this
particular problem is underway, although a firm plan for supply-
ing the desired information in a uniform and expeditious manner
and on a continuing basis has not been completed. However, in
the course of our inquiry it has been observed that the National
Security Agency in many cases would be able to supply additional
data concerning the personalities involved in the form of bio-
graphical or background information which may be of further
assistance to you in this particular effort. With your approval
the scope of the information requested from this Agency will be
enlarged to include this additional material when available.

I wish to assure you that your request is receiving our
careful study and that a basic report will be forthcoming at an
early date.

Sincerely,

RALPH J. CANINE

I wish to thank you for your letter of October 14, 1955 in a
which you stated that there is no reluctance on the part of the 7
“FBI to conduct physical surveillance of selected Latin American [| nae
visitors to this country where the circumstances warrant such oe ~
action. Your assurances that every effort will be made in these
cases to. develop those aspects which may be of particular inter=
est to the Department of State and that consideration will be
= given to the utilization of a physical surveillance when requested t
by the Department of State where it is agreed that this type of ‘

coversge is warranted and necessary, should prove helpful in
handling these cases in the future.

t

When the Department of State has reason to believe that visit-
‘hing Latin Americans may be engaged in planning and coordinating
‘subversive activities directed at other governments of this

.f hemisphere, such information will be brought to the attention of

\ the FBI through established channels as heretofore, together

with an explanation of the Department's objectives and requirenents,¢
im order that an appropriate investigation may be initiated.

“The continued cooperation of the FBI is greatly appreciated.

The Honorable Robert Murphy

Dear Mr. Murphy:

Reference is made to your letter of 10 October. 1955, relative to.
the problem of conducting surveillance of certain Latin American
nationals who might be suspected of carrying on subversive activities:
in the United States, directed against Latin American Countries. In

this regard you are correct in your understanding that the CIA does ~
not conduct such surveillances. within the confines. of the United States.

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The entire facilities of the FBI were committed
to the investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in Memphis, Tennessee, on 4-4-68, and within
five days the man then known as Eric S. Galt was developed
as a prime suspect. From a check of latent fingerprints
against those of white male fugitives for whom "wanted"
notices had been placed in the files of the FBI Identification
Division, James Earl Ray was determined to be the true
identity of Eric S. Galt. At the request of the FBI, Canadian
authorities determined that a Canadian passport had been
issued to Ray in the name of Ramon George Sneyd, and on
June 8, 1968, Ray was arrested by Scotland Yard when he
presented the Sneyd passport to travel from London to
Brussels. At the conclusion of extradition proceedings,
Ray was returned to the United States in custody of FBI Agents
and was turned over to local authorities in Memphis, Tennessee,
for state prosecution. Local trial is scheduled for April 7,
1969.

REPRESENTATIVES - COMPLAINANT
TITLE 2, SECTION 244, USC, ELECTION LAWS

We were instructed by former Assistant Attorney
General Vinson to interview the Chairmen and Treasurers of
20 Republican Committees and one Democratic Committee that
filed late reports with the Clerk of the House of Represen-
tatives. There have been some delays in obtaining necessary
information as well as locating the individuals to be
interviewed. We have kept the Department fully advised of
all developments.

Mr. Daniel W. Hofgren of the White House Staff
declined to be interviewed, indicating the matter would
have to be taken up with the General Counsel at the White
House and the Attorney General. Hofgren indicated he was
speaking on behalf of other employees of the White House.
This, of course, has been reported to the Attorney General.
We are going forward on an expeditious basis with all other
interviews and current developments are being brought to
the attention of the Department.

GARY STEVEN KRIST;
RUTH EISEMANN-SCHIER;
BARBARA JANE MACKLE - VICTIM
KIDNAPING

On December 17, 1968, 20-year-old Barbara Jane Mackle
was abducted from an Atlanta, Georgia, area motel. A $500,000
ransom demand was subsequently made of her father, Robert Mackle,
a Coral Gables, Florida, resident and business official. FBI
investigation resulted in the safe return of Miss Mackle, who had
been buried in a coffin-like box northeast of Atlanta, Georgia; the
recovery of most of the ransom money; and the apprehension of one
of the subjects, identified as Gary Steven Krist. An all-out investi-
gation continues to locate Ruth Eisemann-Schier, the other subject
in this case. Federal charges were filed in Miami, Florida, against
subjects for violation of Extortion Statute, Interstate Transportation
in Aid of Racketeering Statute, and the Aiding and Abetting Statute.
The subjects were indicted in DeKalb County, Georgia, for kidnaping
on January 13, 1969. The Bureau has furnished results of its
investigations to local authorities and is cooperating in the state
trial which will be held in this matter. Krist was brought before the
circuit court in DeKalb County, Georgia, on February 7, 1969, at
which time the court appointed two attorneys to represent him. One
of the attorneys is James R. Venable, who has been for many years
Imperial Wizard for the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.
A three-week delay was requested by the attorneys, and the judge set
the next appearance for February 28, 1969.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS
DISCONTINUANCE OF BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATIONS ON CLERICAL
APPLICANTS FOR THE BUREAU OF
NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS
(BNDD)

The Bureau has been conducting background
investigations on applicants and employees of the BNDD
since that agency came under the jurisdiction of the
Department. These investigations were conducted pursuant
to Departmental Order #175-59 dated April 1, 1959.

Our Chicago Division learned that BNDD had been
conducting preemployment checks to include credit and
criminal investigation, interviews with former employers,
supervisors, and references. On January 21, 1969, both
Assistant Attorney General for Administration Pellerzi
and Associate Director Giordano, BNDD, agreed with the
Bureau's position that conducting duplicate investigations
of clerical applicants for BNDD was a waste of time and
money; however, on February 4, 1969, Mr. Giordano reversed
his position and stated he wanted to run credit and
criminal checks and contact the last two employers to
see if they had any further interest in the clerical applicant.
The Bureau would then be asked to complete the investigation.

Mr. Giordano was told that BNDD should do their own clerical
applicant investigations entirely or the FBI should do
them entirely. The Director noted that he wanted no part
of divided responsibility and this position was confirmed
in our letter to Mr. Pellerzi dated February 6, 1969,
copy attached. This letter advised that effective
immediately we would not accept any additional requests for
investigations of clerical applicants and that, if during
the course of investigations of these people by BNDD,
they should find subversive derogatory information, then
the case should be referred to the Bureau for a full field
investigation under the provisions of the Federal Employee
Security Program.

Since February 6, 1969, we have not accepted
any requests for investigation of clerical people for BNDD.

With regard to the request of Mr. Giordano,
Associate Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
that the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs be permitted
to conduct credit and criminal checks and
contact the last two employers in connection with clerical
applicants, he was informed on February 4, 1969, of the
undesirability of divided responsibility and duplication
of investigative effort by the FBI and the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.
It
was felt that either they should handle these investigations
entirely or the FBI should handle them entirely.
Please be advised that effective immediately
we will not accept any additional requests for
investigations of clerical applicants since this Bureau wants no part of
divided responsibility regarding these investigations or
criticism for any possible duplication of investigative
effort. If during the course of the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs investigations of their clerical
applicants subversive derogatory information is developed, it should be
referred to this Bureau for a full field investigation under
the provisions of the Federal Employee Security Program.

MARTIN EDWARD UNDERWOOD

Underwood, aged 54, was employed for a number of
years as a salesman in Illinois and Maryland. Since 1961 he
has been employed by the United States Government, for the
greater period by the Department of Commerce, and the Small
Business Administration. He was detailed to the White House
in 1966 as an advance man in connection with the travels of
former President Johnson.

We conducted an investigation of Underwood for the
White House in 1965 which revealed he had a serious drinking
problem prior to the investigation and was considered an
alcoholic at one time. He is unmarried and has had two divorces,
the first of which was precipitated by his drinking. Several
people interviewed in the 1965 investigation would not recom-
mend Underwood because of his drinking on the West Coast in
1964. After President Johnson's departure Underwood continued
to hold an office on the first floor of the Executive Office
Building, apparently gaining the favor of Vice President Agnew.
On February 6, 1969, Underwood was removed from his office
and his White House pass has been taken. The White House
has been in contact with the Department of Commerce, on whose
payroll Underwood has been while working at the White House,
and advised the Department of Commerce to inform Underwood
his services are no longer required.

Persons interviewed during our current investigation
state Underwood apparently stopped drinking in 1964 and no
longer has the drinking problem. Results of current investigation
were furnished White House in memorandum dated February 12, 1969.
Several interviews and one agency check remain to be handled.

VIRGINIA STANFILL SAVELL

She was employed by former United States Senator
Thomas H. Kuchel of California in his Los Angeles, California,
office from August, 1961, to September, 1968. She is pres-
ently an assistant to Herbert G. Klein at the White House.

In September, 1966, at the request of
Senator Kuchel, a very discreet inquiry was conducted
into an allegation Senator Kuchel had received that
Mrs. Savell was possibly operating a bookie joint out
of the Senator's Los Angeles, California, office. The
inquiry developed no information to substantiate the
allegation. The investigation did develop information
that Mrs. Savell reportedly was an alcoholic.

The current investigation to date has ascertained
that the South Pasadena, California, Police Department
records indicate Mrs. Savell attempted suicide on July 23,
1967. She reportedly took an overdose of sleeping capsules.

LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE
ADMINISTRATION
WASHINGTON, D. C.

Ganoung, aged 43, has B.A. degree in criminology
and Bachelor of Divinity degree. He is former Episcopalian
priest and has been active in attempting to rehabilitate
sexual deviates and narcotics addicts in San Francisco;
however, no one questioned his character in these connections.
He is presently working as a consultant for the Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration with duty station in
Washington, D. C.

Ganoung has also been active in civil rights and
antidraft demonstrations and twice was arrested in this
connection. He has worked with dissident groups and has
grown a beard and worn beads in this connection. As a
result of running around with another woman, his wife
divorced him in 1967. The expenses of this affair,
including alimony, forced him to file bankruptcy.
A number
of police officers in San Francisco area acquainted with
Ganoung would not recommend him.

Ganoung is a protege of Wesley A. Pomeroy, Asso-
ciate Administrator, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.
Pomeroy has been regarded as immature and insincere by former
police acquaintances.

The results of our investigation of Ganoung were
called to the attention of the Attorney General and the
Deputy Attorney General by letter dated February 11, 1969.

WILLIAM HENRY RENTSCHLER

William Henry Rentschler, aged 43, former news-
paper reporter, has been co-owner and/or President of a
candy company since 1956. He has been extremely active in
Republican Party politics in Illinois for the past several
years. He was involved in adulterous relationship with a
woman other than his wife for approximately three years and
later married that woman. This was a well known fact by
those interviewed and Senator Dirksen said his involvement
in notorious divorce action presents serious question of
his suitability for employment by the Government. Senator
Percy indicated Attorney General Mitchell recently told
him Senator Dirksen had indicated Rentschler could not pass
the rigid background investigation by the FBI. During the
investigation Rentschler was described as articulate and an
intelligent individual who is knowledgeable in the field of
politics. Several persons pointed out he lacks business
ability, fails to follow through on details and does not have
a feeling for finances. Some individuals did not recommend
him for a position of trust, some recommended him with reser-
vations, and some recommended him highly. A summary memorandum
containing the results of investigation to date was furnished
to the White House on February 10, 1969. Outstanding investi-
gation consisted of an interview of Maurice H. Stans, Secre-
tary of Commerce, and several other individuals who have
been unavailable for contact. Secretary Stans has been inter-
viewed and states he cannot recommend Rentschler due to un-
favorable hearsay information concerning his alleged financial
irresponsibility and his moral life. Additional investigation
is necessary based on information furnished by Secretary Stans.

SPECIAL INQUIRY INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

Conscientious security officers in various
governmental agencies, many of whom are former Special
Agents of the Bureau, have been shocked at the lack of
knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the
Federal Employee Security Program by the eight or nine
individuals at the White House responsible for filling
top-level positions in the new Administration. This
first came to our attention shortly after November 6,
1968, when Franklin Benjamin Lincoln, Jr., and
William Rittenhouse Harman moved into the Pentagon
as the vanguard of the transition team. They had no
clearance for highly classified information and when
no request was forthcoming for a full field investiga-
tion of these persons, the security officer at the
Pentagon requested the investigation.

This matter came to a head on February 10, 1969,
when the Secretary of Commerce was told by the White House
to write a letter certifying that prospective Assistant
Secretaries were cleared politically and from a security
standpoint. When the Department of Commerce was told we
had received no request for a full field investigation,
that Department was informed by the White House the FBI
had done a "24-hour check." The Department of Commerce
would not accept this since the Federal Employee Security
Program requires that no critical sensitive jobs should be
filled unless a full field investigation is first conducted.

Most of the requests for investigations received
thus far from the White House are in connection with persons
who have been publicly announced and are already firmly
established in their jobs. As a result, instead of dis-
continuing investigation upon the development of derogatory
data the White House requests the investigation be continued
and at the present time we know of only one person the
Administration has discharged. This was a stenographer
in Mr. Ehrlichman's office by the name of Helen Galanoplos,
who had two brothers and a sister-in-law who were members
of the Communist Party.

In connection with White House investigations Don Virdin
of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) called the Bureau on February 13,
1969. Virdin stated that IRS had checked their files in connection with

NW 88613 Docld:32199554
Page 561
19

--- Page 582 ---

the last 25 persons publicly announced and confirmed by the Senate.
He stated that this check revealed that the Bureau had only asked for
IRS information in connection with about 8 of these 25 people. He
stated he felt this was strange because there was some rather inter-
esting information in connection with some of these people, such as
the fact that one of these individuals, whom he did not identify, had
not filed an income tax return for the past three years. (We have
run checks on all requests received from the White House on
Presidential appointees and it would appear from the above that the
White House only asked for us to conduct investigations on 8 of the
last 25 publicly announced appointees.)

SELECTIVE SERVICE

Selective Service investigations conducted by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent years have
broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the
draft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000
pending investigations, compared to 9,000 a year ago.

In fiscal year 1968, 809 convictions were recorded
as compared to 763 convictions the previous fiscal year.
For the first seven months of fiscal year 1969, 380 convictions
were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a
similar period in the preceding fiscal year. It appears
that such a trend will continue during the current fiscal
year.

There follows a brief summary of an investigation
of interest concerning a Selective Service matter.

At San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned
Erik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with
Selective Service because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn,
had refused to grant permission. For his failing to register,
Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968.

Following arraignment and release on his own
recognizance, a Complaint and Petition for Injunction and
Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the
draft was filed in behalf of the subject. It claims if a person
under 21 years of age cannot vote, control or dispose of
his own property, serve on juries, marry, contract or litigate,
then he cannot register for the draft without his parents'
consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son
principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his
own conscience, bears the main responsibility and should
be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this
case ruled that the son must stand trial for refusing to
register for the draft and rejected the mother's appeals.

A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been
scheduled for March 19, 1969.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE
AND ORGANIZED CRIME

The main thrust of our investigations of organized
crime has been aimed at the key members in the power structure
of La Cosa Nostra in order to secure their imprisonment and
to disrupt leadership. We have also struck hard at the lower
working level who are the money producing figures for the
top-echelon leaders. With progressively greater success, we
have made deeper penetration into the heart of the hoodlum
syndicate, the illegal gambling operations from which it
draws much of its vast resources.

Prosecutions of hoodlums, gamblers, and vice figures
for violating the laws within the Bureau's jurisdiction
have been steadily increasing. For the fourth consecutive
year, convictions have reached new highs, as evidenced by the
fact that during Fiscal Year 1968, our drive against organized
crime resulted in the conviction of 281 organized crime and
gambling figures, compared with the 197 convictions during
the preceding year. In addition, there are now 789 other
individuals awaiting trial in Federal court. The substantial
backlog of individuals awaiting further prosecution indicates
that the upward trend of convictions will continue during
Fiscal Year 1969. However, it is apparent that if we are to
continue to be effective in our drive against the hoodlum
element, prosecutions of these matters must necessarily receive
high priority.

Recent Major Accomplishments

Among our most recent major accomplishments are:
the conviction of Ernest Sansone, Chicago Hoodlum, and five
associates on February 12, 1969, in connection with a wide-
spread race wire dissemination service; the arrest of John
Philip Cerone, current top leader of organized crime in the
Chicago area, along with two accomplices on February 7, 1969,
in connection with the operation of a large-scale gambling
organization; the conviction of West Coast hoodlum figure,
John Roselli, on February 3, 1969, for running an interstate
gambling operation; the conviction of William Daddano, des-
cribed as the 5th ranking mobster in Chicago, and four

NW 68613. Docid:32199554
Page 564

--- Page 585 ---

accomplices on October 3, 1968, for bank robbery; the arrest
on November 26, 1968, of La Cosa Nostra "commission" member
Stefano Magaddino, and eight associates for Interstate Gambling
Activity; the arrest on December 5, 1968, of Pittston, Pa.,
La Cosa Nostra "Boss" Russell Bufalino and two associates for
conspiring to transport some $23,000 worth of stolen television
sets interstate; the September 12, 1968, conviction of
New Orleans La Cosa Nostra "boss" Carlos Marcello for attempting
to assault a Federal officer; the March 21, 1968, arrest of
New Jersey La Cosa Nostra "boss" Samuel Rizzo Decavalcante and
two associates for conspiring to extort money from four gamblers,
and the conviction on March 8, 1968, of New England area
La Cosa Nostra chieftain Raymond Patriarca and one of his
"captains," Henry Tameleo, for violating the Anti-Racketeering
statute in connection with a gambling-murder case.

Dissemination Program

As a result of our dissemination program, 287,004
items of criminal intelligence "type" information were dissem-
inated to other Federal, State, and local law enforcement
agencies during Fiscal Year 1967, 300,244 such items were
disseminated in Fiscal Year 1968, and during the first six
months of the present Fiscal Year we have disseminated 153,214
items. Over one million such items have been disseminated
during the past five years.

With respect to dissemination of information
concerning local gambling operations to other Federal,
State, and local law enforcement agencies throughout the
United States for Fiscal Year 1968, a total of 721 raids
took place; 3751 individuals were arrested of whom 1170 were
convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted to $1,395,069 and
United States currency confiscated amounted to $624,028. In
the first six months of the present Fiscal Year 329 raids
have taken place, 1787 individuals have been arrested, of
whom 771 have been convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted
to $221,021, and United States currency confiscated amounted
to $273,701.

Department of Justice Task Forces on Organized Crime

In the Fall of 1966, the Criminal Division of the
Department initiated the Task Force Operation (also called
Strike Force) and the first one began operation in Buffalo,
New York. These Task Forces consisted of a group comprised

NW 88613. Docid:32199554
Page 565
22

--- Page 586 ---

of Departmental attorneys and investigative personnel from
several different Federal investigative agencies. The FBI
was invited to assign personnel but declined because of its
overall commitments requiring utilization of all of its
Agents. However, we have extended complete cooperation in
the form of information in investigative reports and have
promptly handled all cases within our investigative juris-
diction that were referred to us from the Task Forces.

Since the initial Task Force at Buffalo, the Depart-
ment has formed such groups in Detroit, Michigan; Brooklyn,
New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois;
Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey.

We now maintain liaison with the various Task
Forces but not on a full-time basis.

It has been recommended that (1) we continue to
cooperate on a full-time basis, from the standpoint of
furnishing information to the various Task Forces, (2) that
the Director indicate to the new Attorney General that we
will be happy to assign an FBI Inspector to serve as liaison
with the Department Task Force office in Washington, D. C.,
(3) that a supervisory employee would be assigned by each
SAC to a specific Task Force when such Task Force is established
within a given area where one of our field offices is located,
for liaison purposes.

La Cosa Nostra Leadership Changes

In the New York City area where La Cosa Nostra
"Commission" member Thomas Luchese died during 1967, no
successor has been named to date, primarily because the FBI
was responsible for the arrest and/or conviction of the four
leading contenders, all "captains" or ranking members of the
Luchese "family."

In Chicago, John Philip Cerone, who was being groomed
as the top leader of La Cosa Nostra group in the Chicago area,
was arrested on February 7, 1969, for Interstate Gambling
Activities. Cerone was the interim Chicago leader for Sam
Giancana, who fled to Latin America following his release from
Federal prison and his successor, Sam Battaglia, who is in
Federal prison for violating the Anti-Racketeering Act.

In New York, veteran New York hoodlum Paul Sciacca
presently is the "boss" of a New York City La Cosa Nostra
"family" once headed by the notorious, controversial Joseph
Bonanno.

DEPARTMENT'S MANUAL FOR USE OF ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE UNDER TITLE III OF OMNIBUS
CRIME CONTROL BILL

The Attorney General has been furnished our views
with regard to the Department's draft manual for use of electronic
surveillance pursuant to Title III. The general provisions of
this lengthy manual, much of which concerned administrative
regulations not specifically required by the statute itself,
would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions
on the FBI and other Federal agencies to the point that strict
compliance might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining
discreet electronic surveillance coverage under court supervision
for the purpose of obtaining admissible evidence against the
leadership of organized crime and in other major investigative
categories. These requirements involve an investigative agent's
application for intercept authority to be reviewed by a
comparatively wide range of authorities including the Organized
Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department, in many cases
the United States Attorney, the Assistant Attorney General,
Criminal Division, and finally the Attorney General before the
request even reached the court which, according to the provisions
of this statute, is the ultimate authority and control in the
use of this procedure. This process would, of necessity, be
time-consuming, cumbersome, and, at certain points, repetitious,
and would spread the knowledge of the use of this technique
among a number of different governmental offices.

We noted that the draft manual made repeated reference
to the problem of probable cause becoming "stale" and observed
that the sheer weight of the deliberative process at various
approving levels before it even reached the judge could alone
result in the probable cause becoming "stale." We also noted
that requirements involving daily memoranda to the United States
Attorney concerning the progress of a court authorized surveillance
and other similar administrative requirements would tend to place
burdens on investigating agents which could detract from the
ultimate purpose of our use of this technique.

In connection with the manual's requirement that
an authorized surveillance be terminated when the subject of
the surveillance departed the premises covered, we questioned
that such a requirement was called for in the statute and whether

NW 68613. Docid:32199554
Page 567
24

--- Page 588 ---

Congress, in providing this important added tool in the
evidence gathering process, intended that such a restriction
applied. We also noted that the draft suggested that in all
cases when an application for an order is denied, those named
in the application would be informed that the Government
intended to subject them to electronic surveillance. With
regard to denied applications, we contend that this notice
requirement pertains only to those situations where emergency
intercepts have been made without court order, and thereafter
the court has denied the application and not to all applications
which might be denied in the normal course of business pursuant
to the main body of regulations in Title III.

We concluded our observations to the Attorney
General that while it was appreciated that the drafting of
guidelines in this matter presents extremely sensitive problems,
it was believed that for the Government's ultimate success in
making use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions
must not apply which will create more limitations on law
enforcement than the statute itself prescribes.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
APPENDIX
BLACK PANTHER PARTY
According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY
P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense. NEWTON is presently serving
a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in
connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.
The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics
in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black
people. Residents of the black community are urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to
in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.
"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,
which ends with the following:
"Black men.
Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere: Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.
Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun.
Kill the pigs everywhere.'
Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement,"
we will not dissent from American Government.
We will overthrow it."
Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been
established at various locations throughout the United States.

Fred Hampton
Mother (obscene) know he gonna die before this
trial is over. Yea. A little mother (obscene) (inaudible)
midget faggot facist. This motion will be denied. He
will deny all the motions mother (obscene) because
revolutionaries don't believe in that bull (obscene)
any mother (obscene) way. You can deny (obscene) but
that you grow young again. You know that will never happen.
So I believe the mother (obscene) is so old you just sit
around and try and get young again cause you know when you
get to so many numbers, you understand, on any type of
machine, the mother (obscene) goes back to zero.
Right, right, (obscene) so I'm expecting the
mother (obscene) to be born again while the trial is going
on. Right, have to babysit everybody, right old stupid
mother (obscene) he don't have any business trying to judge
no mother (obscene) body.
In his mother (obscene) years, you understand, he is
living in the rough rider epa (ph) round living, round with
Teddy Roosevelt and all them old stupid mother (obscene).
That's right. He comes to court he is so flabbergasted
by all that new technical (obscene) they got in the (obscene)
court room because when he started judging the stupid mother
NW 88613 Docld:32199554
Page 1127
(obscene) probably had to ride a jackass, you understand,

to his job.
Anybody who would ride a Jackass and smoking
his cigar, and that is what you call a jackass riding a
jackass and that is what you call with a cigar in his
mouth fire on one end and fool on the other, and the
only thing now, only thing that makes a difference is
now he is an old fool. An old fool is worst than a young
fool, in a way, but in a way they are better because they
got less time to be fools if they're old. They got less
time to be a fool. That's right, if the mother (obscene)

On January 13, 1970, the grating in the floor
of the front room of the first floor apartment at 2337
West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois, was measured.

This grating is located 15½ inches from the
south wall and 52 inches from the west wall of the front
room.

The metal frame in the floor measures 20½ inches
from east to west and 17 inches from north to south.

The grating fitted inside of this frame measures 13½ inches
from north to south and 15 inches from east to west. The
grating rests on a ¼ inch steel lip which reduces the
opening to 13 inches by 14½ inches. The drop from the
floor containing the grating to the floor below is 115 inches.
The basement is full of garbage and debris. Directly under
the opening was a large vehicle tire, an old overcoat and

Okay, here's the cleaned-up text, combining the Tesseract and Google Vision OCR outputs, correcting errors, and formatting it for Markdown:

--- Page 2310 ---

In the Q172, Q174, Q176, Q180, Q183 specimens and
the Q178 pillowcase, no bullet or shot pellet holes that could be associated with
bullet or shot pellet holes were found. On the surface of Q176 was a small flattened lead fragment, the source
of which could not be determined.

In the partial bed sheet, Q177, was a cluster of
holes, each approximately three-tenths of an inch in diameter. These
holes could represent a pattern produced by a buckshot-loaded
shotgun. Based upon the shot spread, the weapon could
have been approximately fifteen to twenty feet from the
sheet when discharged.

Numerous holes were in the chenille bedspread/
blanket, Q179. The heavy black rings around several of the
holes in the bedspread could be bullet lubricant. The
size of these holes are comparable to what may have been produced by
bullets. Other holes could have been produced by shot,
but the specific sources of the objects producing these
could not be identified.

There were several holes in the green blanket,
the sources of which could not be determined.

Specimen Q183 was so torn from obvious wear that it
would be impossible to distinguish holes caused by wear
from those caused either by bullets or pellets.

Group A human blood was identified on Q168, Q173,
Q175, Q177 through Q180, Q182 and Q183. Grouping
tests conducted on the human bloodstains on Q172, Q174 and
Q181 were inconclusive. Human blood which was too limited
in amount for grouping purposes was identified on Q180.

Representative fibers from each of the above-listed
specimens were obtained for logical comparisons with fibers
adhering to bullets and lead fragments recovered in this case.

Q159 - Wood panel 70" by 24", FBI #304
Q160 - Wood splinters, FBI #132
Q161 - Window shutters, FBI #305

Results of examination:

The large hole in the Q159 panel is comparable in size
to one produced in tests by a 12-gauge rifled slug. The
pock-marked area surrounding this hole appears to have been
caused by the displacement of varnish that was struck by
powder residue. The same pattern was obtained when
shots were fired in the Q159 panel. The pattern on Q159 is
comparable to one that would be obtained when the shotgun
muzzle was from 12" to 18" from the panel and nearly perpendicular
to the panel when discharged. Entrance was on the pock-marked
side of the panel.

The small hole in Q159 has the appearance of a bullet
hole and could have been produced by a caliber .38 bullet
from the side of the panel opposite that into which the shot
producing the large hole was fired. The shot producing this
hole was fired from left to right at an angle of about 15°
from the panel surface and about 15° downward.

Material taken from the large hole in specimen Q159
was analyzed spectrographically and found to exhibit a minute
quantity of foreign lead.

NW 88613 Docld:32199554
Page 2311

--- Page 2312 ---

The small hole in specimen Q159 bore deposits of a
grey metallic material. A microscopic examination of these
deposits was made and no copper-like metal smears or particles
were present. However, a spectrographic examination of these
deposits revealed the presence of foreign lead, copper and
antimony.

The copper coating and underlying metal of the Q253
bullet previously examined were analyzed and compared with the
deposits surrounding the small hole in Q159. The copper
coating of the Q253 bullet contains tin which was not detected
in the deposits around the small hole in specimen Q159.

Copper smears which were found surrounding the holes
in specimen Q161 were analyzed spectrographically and found to
consist of foreign copper with extremely minute quantities
of lead.

Two holes which could have been produced by caliber .30
carbine bullets are present in the Q161 shutters. Each hole
is about .3" in diameter. Entrance was on the blue painted
side of the shutters. The projectile causing the hole in the
right shutter entered at an angle of approximately 72° (with
reference to the face of the shutters), traveling from right
to left. This hole was 10 1/8" from the bottom and 4 7/8" from
the right edge. The line of fire was approximately horizontal.

The hole in the left shutter is 10 3/8" from the
bottom and 1 3/4" from the left edge. The projectile causing
this hole was traveling nearly horizontally from right to
left at an angle of approximately 60° from the panel surface.

No other holes or impressions in the Q161 shutters
that have the appearance of bullet or shot holes were found.

the same .30 Carbine as specimens Q226, Q234 and Q245 listed above
or the caliber .30 Universal Carbine, serial number 66174,
previously referred to as K27. It follows, therefore, that specimens
Q40, Q41, Q52 and Q226 were also fired from the caliber .30
Universal Carbine, serial number 66174, specimen K27.

Specimen Q226 is a bullet of the type loaded into

.38 SPECIAL BULLETS

Specimens Q253 and Q277 are .38 Special copper-coated
lead bullets that were identified as having been fired from
the same caliber .38 Special Colt revolver, serial number 857237, previously
submitted and referred to as K12, carried by Officer Groth.
Specimen Q253 weighs 198.0 grains. Specimen Q277 weighs 199.69
grains. Standard weight is 200.0 grains.

Specimen Q233 is a Remington-Peters type .38 Special
lead bullet fired from a .38 Special with Colt-type rifling.
It was not possible, from the marks present, to identify this
bullet with any of the submitted Colt revolvers.
Specimen Q233 weighs 152.835 grains. Standard weight is 158.0
grains.

Specimen Q246 is a badly mutilated Remington-Peters
type .38 Special bullet. It could not have been fired from the Colt
revolver referred to as specimen K41. Specimen Q246 weighs
165.4 grains. Standard weight is 158.0 grains.

SHOTGUN WADS FROM SCENE

Specimen Q199 contained a 12-gauge shotgun wad
composed of purple paper fibers and is like the over powder
wads in 12-gauge Remington Express 00 Buck shotshells.

Specimen Q242 is a composition wad like those in
12-gauge Federal Hi-Power and 12-gauge Federal Monark
shotshells.

Specimen Q248 is a cardboard cover powder wad like those
in 12-gauge Remington-Peters 00 Buck shotshells.

SHOT PELLETS COMPARABLE IN SIZE AND/OR WEIGHT TO
00 BUCK

The shot pellets submitted that are comparable in
size and/or weight to 00 Buck shot pellet are Q201, Q208,
Q213, Q223, Q241, Q268 (book), Q270 and Q278.

The 5 shot pellets removed from Q264 book, Q270 and Q278.

SHOT PELLETS COMPARABLE IN SIZE AND/OR WEIGHT TO
0 BUCK

The shot pellets submitted that are comparable in
size and/or weight to 0 Buck shot pellets are Q231 and Q232.

SHOT PELLETS COMPARABLE IN SIZE AND/OR WEIGHT TO
#4 BUCK

In specimen Q271 are two shot pellets comparable
in weight to #4 Buck shot. They are both too deformed
for accurate measurement.

There are eighteen shot pellets in Q272 none of which are
mutilated. They may have come from the unfired 12-gauge Federal
Monark Field Load #5, shotshell, Q244, as some of the pellets, like
those in Q264 book, are coated with white paint.

Specimen Q237 is a large flattened lead
fragment weighing 346.0 grains. There is nothing characteristic about
its size or shape in its present condition, to permit
identification of its source. Q237 is a rifled lead
slug evidence of weight loss. At 346.0 grains in its
present condition, and considering its weight loss, if any,
it would fall in the classification of a 12-gauge
rifled slug. Its present weight, without considering
weight loss, is slightly less than standard for a 12-gauge
rifled slug. A 16-gauge rifled slug (approximately 7/8 of
an ounce) weighs 345.1 grains (Western Super X 16-gauge
rifled slugs). A 12-gauge rifled slug (approximately
one ounce) weighs 437.5 grains (Western Super X
12-gauge rifled slug).

One shot pellet, Q229, was comparable in size to
#7 1/2 shot. Some weight loss was evident and while the
diameter was comparable to that of #7 1/2 shot, its
weight was slightly less than standard for #7 1/2 shot.

SHOT PELLET COMPARABLE IN SIZE AND/OR WEIGHT TO #8 SHOT

One shot pellet, Q208, was found to be comparable in
size and weight to #8 shot. This pellet was not deformed
and did not possess markings normally present on a shot
pellet that had been fired from a shotgun.

LEAD FRAGMENTS THAT COULD NEITHER BE ASSOCIATED WITH SHOT

Specimen Q225 is a distorted brass primer cup that
appears to have separated from a cartridge or shotshell as a
result of a primer "blowback". This occurs when the powder
charge is ignited by some means other than normal firing of a
cartridge or shotshell and resulting pressure blows the primer
from the cartridge or shotshell.

The book "Family Guide Emergency Health Care", Q264,
was struck by a 00 Buck pellet. The pellet entered the upper
left hand corner of the front of the book, penetrating the
first twenty-six pages. A 00 Buck shot pellet was removed
from the book at this point.

The book entitled "First Aid", Q265, has a hole in the
upper left- corner that could have been produced by a shot
pellet, size not known. No pellets were found in the book and
no exit holes were found. The hole in the middle right of
the cover appears to have been made by a tapered pointed
instrument, such as a pencil, penetrating the cover from the
inside to the outside. There is no indication this hole was
produced either by a shot pellet or by a bullet.

Another hole was in the right edge of this book,
where a shot pellet of unknown size struck the book. A
deposit resembling graphite like the graphite with which shot
pellets are coated was on the pages of the book where
penetration occurred. No shot pellet was found.

(continued on next page)

The book "Toward the African Revolution by Frantz
Fanon" Q210, was struck by two 00 Buck shot pellets that entered
the top right corner of the book. The two pellets were
recovered along with a small piece of steel with white enamel
surface. This steel fragment was cupped in such a manner to
suggest one of the pellets recovered struck an intervening
object, tearing the steel fragment from it and carrying it
into the book. It was found on the same page as the two
00 Buck shot pellets.

EXAMINATION OF SUIT OF CLOTHES

Specimen Q279, a suit of clothes consisting of a
coat and one pair of pants on a wire hanger was found to have
been struck with #8 shot from two shotgun charges. One charge
struck the lower left front of the coat below the pocket
opening. The shot penetrated the pants near the belt line
through the rear pocket which was probably hanging downward
from the pants on the hanger. The pellets exited through the
lower left back of the coat. The shot dispersal is typical
of that which would be fired at roughly a 45° angle to the
right of the front of the coat. The pattern is typical of
one produced at a distance of from six to nine feet.

A second charge struck the lower portion of the
right sleeve. An exit hole was in the back of the right sleeve
and a small number of pellets entered the lower right front
of the coat below the pocket opening. The shot producing
the hole in the sleeve was fired at approximately right
angles to the material of the sleeve, also at a distance of
from six to nine feet based on shot dispersal. It was
not possible to determine from what direction within the
premises the shots producing the holes in the suit were fired
as it is not known where the suit was hanging at the time the
shots were fired.

EXAMINATION OF PINK CAPSULE AND PLANT MATERIAL

Chemical and instrumental examinations of the
capsule, specimen Q238, showed the presence of propoxyphene
hydrochloride. Propoxyphene hydrochloride, an analgesic and
narcotic, is dispensed in capsules similar to specimen Q238 by
Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name "DARVON". A portion
of this material was consumed in the examination.

The plant material, specimen Q240, did not contain
any marijuana. This specimen was consumed in the examination.

BLOOD EXAMINATIONS

Human blood which was too limited in amount for
grouping purposes was identified on specimens Q192, Q197,
Q199, Q279 and Q279. No blood was identified on Q190, Q238
and Q240.

Fibers were found on the following bullets and metal
fragments: Q200, Q201, Q210, Q213, Q215, Q223, Q233, Q237,
Q239, Q251 and Q260.

Several sisal fibers were adhering to Q260. These
fibers have the same appearance as fibers in the composition
of the Q164 and Q167 mattresses and could have come from
them.

No other fibers were found in the above-listed
bullets and metal fragments that could be associated with the
mattress, bedding or clothing submitted previously.

WOOD EXAMINATIONS

The wood on the Q206 bullet and the wood on Q234
are softwoods such as pine, spruce or fir. The wood
fragments are too small for species identification.

The wood fragments on Q231 and Q246 are pine such as
Idaho white pine or northern white pine. These fragments are
too small for species identification.

The wood on the Q134 slide, the wood found on Q218,
Q231 and Q246 could not have originated from the three plies
of the Q159 panel previously submitted which consists of
plywood of birch outer layers and an American sweet gum inner ply.

EXAMINATIONS OF FIBERS

White cotton fibers were present on Q200, Q202, Q211,
Q213, Q215 and Q243; however, white cotton fibers are too common
and possess too few individual microscopic characteristics to
be associated with a particular source.

(continued on next page)

NW 88613 Docld:32199554
Page 2323

--- Page 2324 ---

Other fibers for which no source could be found were
black synthetic fibers on Q200; a yellow-green cotton fiber,
a white woolen fiber and a green paper fiber on Q201; a white
synthetic fiber and three green paper fibers on Q210; a
black woolen fiber, a red cotton fiber and a green paper fiber
on Q215; a black woolen fiber on Q233; an orange woolen
fiber on Q237 and a blue acrylic fiber on Q251.

Fragments of foam were adhering to Q233. These
foam fragments are different from the foam in the composition
of the Q164 specimen.

Fragments of tan paper were adhering to Q237. These
paper fragments are different from the paper in the composition
of the Q164 specimen.

PAINT EXAMINATIONS

Specimen Q208 exhibits deposits of paint which exhibit
the following layer structure:

(1) Light brown varnish
(2) Beige paint
(3) Dark brown paint

Specimen Q218 exhibits deposits of a blue paint
intermixed with plaster-like material.

Specimens Q219 and Q235 exhibit thin contaminated
deposits of a gray paint-like material that is too contaminated
for comparison purposes.

Specimen Q237 bears heavy deposits of a green metallic
nitrocellulose lacquer paint.

Q244, Q245, Q246, Q250, Q253, Q267, Q271
and Q273 - Lime-gypsum-sand plaster was found
on or in these specimens.

Specimens Q190, Q226, Q231, Q242 and Q255, each had a
trace of a white material which was too limited in amount for
significant comparison purposes.

No glass, gypsum or plaster was found on or in Q212,
Q237, Q239 and Q260.

Results of examination:

From a preliminary examination of specimen
Q284, it was possible to identify it as a caliber .380 auto bullet
having general rifling characteristics consisting of six
grooves.

The nose of this bullet was compressed in a manner
consistent with that of a bullet striking a brick wall at an
angle represented by the trajectory of a bullet that struck
the hole in a piece of timber in the northwest corner of the
living room at the premises, 2337 West Monroe Street, Chicago,
Illinois.

It was concluded that none of the weapons submitted
for examination could have fired Q284.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
Date: June 11, 1970

On June 1, 1970, upon the writer's return to
duty from extended sick leave, an attempt was made to
examine the evidence in this case maintained under custody
of the Chicago Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Office
in Room 2114 of the Federal Building, 219 South Dearborn
Street, Chicago, Illinois. However, the key originally
assigned to the Chicago FBI Office to this room by K. William
O'Connor, Civil Rights Attorney, United States Department
of Justice, would no longer open the lock.

Mrs. Henrietta Sinsky, Room 280, Federal Building,
Office of General Services Administration (GSA), advised on
June 10, 1970, that GSA had received authorization from
Mr. Jack Meyer, in charge of property for United States
Attorney's (USA) Office, Room 1500, Federal Building, to
clean this room and to change the lock. She does not
recall the exact date this was completed, but that it was
approximately during the last week in May, 1970.

Mrs. Sinsky with the writer entered Room 2114
on June 10, 1970, and observed that the room had been
cleaned of all surplus boxes and packaging materials and
that there remained in the room three items each containing
the sticker "Evidence Federal Bureau of Investigation

An examination of these items by the writer
disclosed they contained the following items:

RE: MALCOLM X “BLACK HAND SOCIETY OF THE WORLD INC.”

Source indicated that various honorary awards
were granted to Negroes in attendance and these awards
presented by the Malcolm X Black Hand Society of the
World, Inc., went to Dick Gregory, Huey Newton, and
Bobby Seale, both BPP members and which awards were
accepted by Fred Hampton. Several other of these
awards were given to persons who the source could not
identify.

A characterization of the BPP is attached.

Source advised that Carolyn Rodgers read
some of her poems, two of which were entitled "I Ain't
Gone Nothin' Yet" and "Poem For Malcolm".

Source identified Fred Hampton of the Chicago
BPP as the next speaker and Hampton expressed his
great love and respect for Malcolm X and for his philo-
sophies, stating that Malcolm X had gone to the mountain
and come back to realize that he was still a
"suppressed nigger". Hampton stated that Malcolm X
saw that change was necessary and from that point in
Hampton's speech, he gave a typical BPP speech concerning
the necessity for Negroes arming themselves to beat
back the oppressor. Hampton concluded by stating that
he was a revolutionary, with the comments "all power
to the people, all power to the BPP, Panther Power".

Source stated that Dick Gregory was the last
speaker, but limited his comments to the necessity for
black people organizing themselves in their own behalf
and indicated he was in sympathy with the BPP.

Source advised that because of inclement
weather, the scheduled picnic to precede the evening
rally at the Capitol Theater did not take place, other
than a few members of the Malcolm X Black Hand Society
of the World, Inc., being present to direct those
appearing to attend the nighttime rally.

A copy of this communication is being furnished
to the United States Attorney and U.S. Secret Service,
both Chicago, and Region I, 113th Military Intelligence
Group, Evanston, Illinois.

The March 13, 1964, edition of "The New York Times,"
a daily newspaper published in New York, New York, contained
an article on page 20 which indicated that MALCOLM X (LITTLE),
then Minister of the Nation of Islam (NOI) who broke
on March 8, 1964, publicly announced in New York
on March 12, 1964, that he had formed the Muslim Mosque,
Incorporated (MMI). The MMI, according to the article, would
be a politically oriented black nationalist organization
financed only by voluntary contributions.
In that public statement, MALCOLM X urged Negroes to abandon
the philosophy of non-violence when it is necessary to defend
themselves in the civil rights struggle, and he also suggested
that Negroes form rifle clubs to protect their lives and
property in time of emergencies in areas where the government
is unable or unwilling to protect them.

Incorporation papers of the MMI filed on March 16,
1964, with the Business Section, Clerk of Courts, New York,
New York, reflect that the MMI was organized
under the Religious Corporation Law of the State of
New York for the imparting of the Islamic Faith and
religious teachings in accordance with accepted Islamic
doctrines. The principal place of worship to be located in
the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York.

The May 23, 1964, edition of the "New York Amsterdam
News," a weekly Negro newspaper published in New York City,
contained an article by columnist JAMES BOOKER in which he
stated that he had heard that the visit by MALCOLM X with
African leaders during his African tour has changed him to
(1) become more affiliated with the true option of white
people, (2) to have white feelings and (3) to become more
confidential.

This non-confidential source advised on May 17, 1965,
that the headquarters of the MMI are located in Suite 124,
Hotel Theresa, 2090 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York, where
these headquarters are combined with the Organization of
Afro-American Unity.

MALCOLM X was assassinated on February 21, 1965,
while addressing an OAAU rally at the Audubon Ballroom,
Broadway and 166th Street, New York City.

The same confidential source advised on September 8,
1965, that activities of the MMI following the death of
Malcolm X were limited to the teaching of classes in the
Islamic religion, and a class in judo for self-protection.
These classes were held regularly until the latter part of
1965 when they were discontinued. Since then, there have been
no meetings and there has been absolutely no activity of
the MMI which appears to be completely "dead".

ORGANIZATION OF AFRO-AMERICAN UNITY,
INCORPORATED (OAAU)

On June 28, 1964, MALCOLM X LITTLE, founder and leader
of the Muslim Mosque, Incorporated (MMI), publicly announced the
formation of a new, all Negro, militant civil rights action group
to be known as the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU),
with himself as Chairman. This announcement was made at a public
rally held by the MMI in the Audubon Ballroom, Broadway and 166th
Street, New York City.

A printed and published statement of basic OAAU aims read
by MALCOLM X at this meeting indicates that it shall include "all"
people of African descent in the Western Hemisphere, as well as
"our" brothers and sisters on the African continent. It is patterned
after the "letter and spirit" of the Organization of African Unity
established (by African heads of States) at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
in May, 1963.

A recording of the remarks of MALCOLM X at this meeting
indicates that the aim of the OAAU is to eliminate differences
between Negroes so they can work together for "human rights,"
while the initial objective is to "internationalize" the American
civil rights movement by taking it to the United Nations. LITTLE
condemned the non-violent civil rights movement and claims that
Negroes should be taught to protect themselves, when and if
necessary. The OAAU will sponsor a program for Negroes in
education, politics, culture, economics, and social reform.

MALCOLM X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, while
addressing an OAAU rally at the Audubon Ballroom, New York City.

On April 13, 1965, a confidential source advised that
on March 26, 1965, the OAAU filed a Certificate of Incorporation
with the Department of State, State of New York, Albany, New York,
and henceforth, the organization's true name will be Organization
of Afro-American Unity, Incorporated.

On April 29, 1968, a second confidential source advised
that the president and head of the OAAU is ELLA COLLINS, a half
sister of the late MALCOLM X, who resides a great majority of the
time in Boston, Massachusetts.

On April 28, 1968, this same source advised that the OAAU
headquarters is still located at 224 West 139th Street, New York,
New York. Meetings have not been held in several months and the
organization appears to be breaking up and no longer functioning.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, "the Black Panther Party
(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement,
we will not dissent from American Government... We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic
of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of
the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

Where appropriate, the information has been
disseminated to local authorities.

Informant furnished the following information on
May 8, 1969:

There was a BPP meeting on May 7, 1969, at ROBERT
BRUCE's house, 28 South 15th Avenue, Maywood. FRED HAMPTON
was there for only a few minutes and gave out 200 flyers to
be passed out around town concerning a mock trial of himself
to be held on May 9, 1969. Present were BRUCE, WALTER ALLEN,
WILMA and MATTHEW ANGRUM, TYRONE GLADNEY, and NEAL THOMAS.
THOMAS sells the newspaper "Black Panther" around town for
25 cents a copy.

On May 9, 1969, the informant made available the following
material:

One copy of "The Black Panther" newspaper dated
April 20, 1969.

One copy of a flyer "Howat of Political Prasoner Roi
dated May 9, 1969.

One copy of "To the oppressed People etc." no date.

One copy of "In the Summer of 1968 etc." no date.

Informant advised on May 9, 1969, that there will be a
dance to raise funds in Argo tonight (May 9, 1969), and
therefore, the mock trial has been postponed. One of the flyers
gives the time and place of the dance.

FRED HAMPTON will be sentenced on May 13, 1969,
and on that date the Black Panthers intend to cause disturbances
in Maywood, according to talk at the meeting on May 7, 1969.

Informant advised on May 14, 1969 as follows:

The dance last Friday night was strictly a social
fund raising event and there was no trouble.

There was a meeting of the BPP on the evening of
May 12, 1969, at BRUCE's house. They were HAMPTON, BRUCE,
WALTER ALLEN, the ANGRUMs, DAVID VALENTINE, NEAL THOMAS and
several young teenage boys. They were still talking about
possibly blowing up the Maywood Police Station when HAMPTON
is sentenced but they did not mention where they would get the
explosives or how they would do it. HAMPTON's sentencing has
been postponed until a later date. The informant believes the
plot to blow up the station is just talk.

HAMPTON obtained ten used pistols, some 22 caliber flats
and has sold them to members of the BPP in Maywood and Chicago.

GREGORY PERKINS said that whenever HAMPTON or
NATHANIEL JUNIOR are being sought on warrants, they live in
at the BPP headquarters, 2350 West Madison, in Chicago, until
they can get the bond money and surrender with their attorneys.

been disseminated to local authorities.
Informant advised on 5/22:

One CHARLES KROP, who lives at 1715 South
6th Avenue, runs a restaurant in the 600 block of
South 5th Avenue, in Maywood. He is a white man,
married to a Mexican woman. He is the leader
apparently of the "Brown Berets." The Black Panthers
are using a room behind the restaurant to meet
occasionally.

FRED HAMPTON stated the Brown Berets are
joining the Panthers during their meeting to deter-
mine if they have mutual interests.

NW 88613 Docld:32199554

--- Page 2962 ---

Informant stated there are rumors around
Argo-Summit that NATHANIEL JUNIOR and DENNIS HARVEY
are seeking a way to go to Cuba before they are
arrested. Informant stated he believes JUNIOR
is at 2350 West Madison hiding out.

Informant advised the BPP meeting on
5/21 was held at Chuck's Record Shop, 1019 South
7th. The only thing discussed was the mock
trial to be held at the Old Lutheran Seminary,
1644 South 11th Avenue, on Saturday night at
8:00 p.m. This building is used by the O.S.O.
and apparently someone made it available to the BPP.
Informant advised on 5/24:

The place of the mock trial was changed
to the Village Hall in Maywood for 5/24, and 25/69.
ALL persons are invited.
FRED HAMPTON expects to be sentenced
on 5/26, and needs $3,000-$4,000 bond money
to stay out of jail during his appeal.

Informant advised on 5/26/69:

The mock trial went smoothly Saturday
and Sunday night. More than 100 people attended,
half black and half white. HAMPTON was found "not
guilty." HAMPTON was his own lawyer. No violence
occurred.

Informant advised on 5/28/69:

ROBERT BRUCE is very unhappy because
FRED HAMPTON was kept in jail without an appeal
bond. He tried to get the BPP to meet and
discuss ways of raising bond money, but was
unsuccessful on 5/26, and 5/27.

BRUCE said the BPP should wait about
a week or a week and a half to see if HAMPTON
will get out on bond. After that, if he is not out,
then there will be plans made for destruction of property
in Maywood.

SUBJECT: RACIAL TENSIONS,
MAYWOOD, ILLINOIS, 1969.
RM

Where appropriate, the information has been
disseminated to local authorities.

Informant advised on June 5, 1969, the following:

There was a meeting of the BPP at Charles Krop's
Restaurant on 5th Avenue in Maywood on the night of May 28,
1969. About 20 BPP members were present as well as several
Brown Berets. They had large photos of FRED HAMPTON and
were going to put them into several shops in Maywood as
part of a "Free HAMPTON" Campaign. The meeting was actually
held in the old photo store next to the restaurant which is
closed and boarded up. It is entered through the restaurant.

BOBBY CARSWELL and GREGORY PERKINS are the two
BPP members who are spearheading the campaign to raise
money for HAMPTON's bond.

The informant stated he thinks SPACO CHARLIE,
who is CHARLES KROP, is somewhat crazy.

--- Page 2964 ---

ROBERT BRUCE is now too scared to do anything
and it appears he wants to be less involved in the BPP.

PERKINS and THOMAS BLAIR planned to visit
HAMPTON in jail, date unknown.

During the weekend of May 31-June 1, 3 or 4
BPP members went around in Maywood and got 200 names on
a petition to free FRED HAMPTON. HAMPTON's older brother,
MURTHY WADE, BOBBY CARSWELL and NEAL THOMAS, are the
ones who obtained the petitions.

CARSWELL said that "Spaco Charlie" has promised
to get ammunition for the BPP. He apparently has a
card of some type which enables him to buy guns and
ammunition. He seems to do everything CARSWELL asks
him to do.

Informant advised on June 6, 1969:

There was a meeting on June 5, 1969, at the home
of GENE MOORE, 1423 South 11th Avenue. He is a supporter
of FRED HAMPTON, but not a member of the BPP.

About 50 Negroes were present, mostly BPP
members and they were all angry about the FBI raid on
BPP headquarters in Chicago.

The discussion centered around the fact that
the raid must have been set up by someone inside. They
also claimed the purpose of the raid was to get the
petitions for HAMPTON's release so he would be kept
in jail. They were all angry about the theft of the
money and typewriters by the FBI.

CARSWELL said that NATHANIEL JUNIOR and HARVEY
had left the headquarters two days before the FBI raid and
had "gone south".

The BPP does not trust SPACO CHARLIE. Some
members feel he will eventually turn against the Negroes.

NW 88613 Docld:32199554

--- Page 2965 ---

A new petition will be circulated by the BPP
to get DUFFY removed from the Maywood PD. He is the
officer who testified against HAMPTON at his recent
trial.

A rally is planned for FRED HAMPTON on
June 12, 1969, at 2:00 PM at the Lido Theatre in Maywood.
All will be invited and money will be collected for
HAMPTON's release.

The rally for FRED HAMPTON was held on this date,
6/12/69, from 3:00 PM to 5:45 PM at the Lido Theatre in
Maywood. The microphones and sound system were set up by
GREGORY PERKINS who then left to go to work. The rally was
run by WILLIAM HAMPTON, FRED's older brother. There were
nearly 200 people present including whites, blacks, and
Mexicans. Represented were the BPP from Chicago, the Brown
Berets, someone from SDS who made a speech, several stu-
dents from a college somewhere, a few clergymen including
a Negro preacher from Melrose Park who read a note from
FRED HAMPTON's mother.

LEO HOWARD spoke, WILLIAM HAMPTON spoke, an SDS
leader spoke, a representative from the Brown Berets spoke
and PAUL WADE spoke. All spoke about the plights of HAMPTON
and a collection was taken up. There was much concern about
the fact that HAMPTON was moved to some jail about 300 miles
away.

PAUL WADE spoke and said they should all go to
where HAMPTON is and break him out of jail. He also said
that if the police invade any Negro homes that the Negroes
should shoot it out with the police if they are entering
illegally.
A collection was taken for HAMPTON.

ROBERT BRUCE is around town somewhere in hiding.
He is being sought on a Chicago Kidnapping Warrant. He is
one of the Sixteen indicted for this crime.

Informant advised that NEAL THOMAS had withheld
money collected for the BPP and they were going to kill him,
but he pleaded for his life and the BPP decided to give him
another chance.

Informant advised on 6/15/69:
ROBERT BRUCE was at WALTER ALLEN's house in
Broadview this morning. He will probably be at a meeting
at "Spaco Charlies" restaurant, Maywood, at 8:00 PM tonight.
This meeting was called to discuss ways of getting money to
help BRUCE get out of Maywood to Chicago.

ORGANIZATION OF BLACK
AMERICAN CULTURE (OBAC)
(BLACK UNITED FESTIVAL,
AUGUST 16, 1969, DIXMOOR,
ILLINOIS)

On August 15, 1969, a first source, who has
furnished reliable information in the past, advised
that the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC),
a group that sponsors black cultural enrichment
programs in the Chicago area and maintains office
space at 77 East 35th Street, Chicago, planned to
hold a festival at Dixmoor Park, 140th and Wood
Streets, Dixmoor, Illinois, on August 16, 1969.

The festival is being called the Black
United Festival. It is to be centered around an
exhibition of black art and crafts. Two sessions are
scheduled, one in the afternoon from 12:00 noon until
5:00 p.m. and the other in the evening from 7:00 p.m.
to 11:00 p.m. The evening session is to feature the
following speakers: Russ Meek, representing the
Black Impeachment Committee (BIC); Bob Lucas,
representing the Black Liberation Alliance (BLA);
Leonard Sengahli, representing the Blackstone Rangers,
a Chicago Negro youth gang; and Fred Hampton,
representing the Black Panther Party (BPP) of Illinois.
Matilda Haywood, a female Negro singer, an associate
of Russ Meek, is scheduled to entertain.

A characterization of the BPP is attached
hereto.

sions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It is

OBAC (BLACK UNITED FESTIVAL,
AUGUST 16, 1969, DIXMOOR, ILLINOIS)

The source advised that OBAC has obtained
a local permit from local authorities to use the
park. OBAC has agreed to conclude the affair by
11:00 p.m. which is considered the regular closing
hour for the park.

This source advised that there is no
indication that any disturbance should occur at this
affair.

A second source, an agency which collects
intelligence data in the Chicago area, has advised
in the past that Russ Meek is a militant Negro who
has made a number of speeches in the Chicago area
expressing hatred for whites. Meek has claimed that
law enforcement officers are determined to exterminate
black people. Meek has also urged that Negroes
arm themselves.

According to this source, the Black Impeach-
ment Committee (BIC) is a "paper" organization which
has been created by Meek. BIC is without any active
membership.

The Black Liberation Alliance (BLA) is a
community action group focusing attention on local
organizing through local community councils, working
on a daily basis with members of the black community
on such problems as housing, education, health and
welfare problems.

On August 16, 1969, Clifford Wood, Chief of
Police, Dixmoor, Illinois, advised that festival
activity at Dixmoor Park between the hours of 12:00
noon and 5:00 p.m. was limited to a group of about
eight to ten persons, all Negro, setting up public
address-type equipment.

Chief Wood stated that at about 7:00 p.m.
a group of about 50 to 75 persons, all Negro, both
male and female, had gathered in the park. The
number of individuals in attendance fluctuated
inasmuch as people were constantly arriving and

constantly leaving during the evening session of the
festival.

Chief Wood stated that festival activity
consisted of entertainment by a singer, and a number
of short speeches, the subject matter of which
pertained to solving Negro problems. There were
demonstrations of African-style dancing and
performances of African-type music.

Chief Wood stated that by 11:00 p.m.,
August 16, 1969, the festival activities were over
and all individuals who had attended had left the
park area. There
