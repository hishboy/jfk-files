SUBJECT: IDEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee
NFL-002-76
14 January 1976

1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BKHERALD staff employee, on 7 January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A spoke for several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is a long summation of his comments, and at the memo's conclusion his reasons for bringing this situation to our attention. [Forwarded under Separate Cover].

2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Pigs activities, and who was associated with JMWAVE during the period 1961-68, has maintained many contacts within the Cuban community in Florida. LNCOLLAR, which was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubans) in the drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantime, had moved to Key West, Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a respected member of the community.

3. In late 1973, a former BKHERALD asset (AMTABY Project) who had been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, came to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug traffic. He asked IDEN A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he was retired and could not help. A few months later, IDEN D (AMTABY-27), another former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed him LNCOLLAR had sent him down to check on IDEN C. IDEN D identified his LNCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff employee, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being staffed with BKHERALD employees in its Intelligence Division, and that the leader of the division was IDEN G, another BKHERALD staffer.

4. A few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another BKHERALD retiree, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela. He photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to IDEN A he was LNCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

two BKHERALD people in Miami wanted to meet with IDEN A. IDEN A agreed to a meeting, and IDEN F introduced IDEN I and IDEN E. IDEN A knew IDEN I, but was aware of IDEN E only by reputation, which was unsavory. IDEN E claimed to be a BKHERALD employee, as did IDEN I. IDEN A, of course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, IDEN A got a call from IDEN J of the IDEN K, Miami. He was an ex-BKHERALD officer, and he said IDEN G wished to speak with IDEN A in Miami on an urgent basis.

5. IDEN G told IDEN A that he wanted the latter to work for LNCOLLAR to establish intelligence networks in the Cuban community in Key West. He said no one else could do it, and he promised to provide at the start US$100/week plus expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said this money would not be reportable as income. When IDEN A asked about the effect of his own ex-BKHERALD status, IDEN G replied BKHERALD does not want or need to know of this arrangement. IDEN G acknowledged that US$100/week was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of dollars) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split the money with his agents. IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that within a year IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster boat available.

6. IDEN G and IDEN J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature of his assignment. They stressed cover as the most important consideration, and IDEN G said, "I don't want to go to any more funerals". They added that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami who would come to his aid instantly. IDEN A was given emergency telephone numbers and code names, and was told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his airlift out (through the LNTUCK Air Station) if needed. If his LNCOLLAR affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided up to US$40 thousand, as well as relocation assistance. The relocation assistance was not specified, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months living expenses and assistance in job search activities, as well as reimbursement for moving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD official, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what he knew about drug traffickers in the Key West area. Two weeks later, the two did appear in Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much additional data.

7. IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began sending back reports. IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with IDEN G. Often these meetings were a waste of time, and on occasion IDEN G

would not even show up. At one point IDEN J asked IDEN A to write a paper on the capability of ex-BKHERALD assets who were drug traffickers, and who had been trained in infiltration and exfiltration, to penetrate WODUAL coastal defenses with drugs. IDEN A showed how the assets could circumvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper "scared LNCOLLAR to death," according to IDEN A. At the end of June 1974, IDEN J asked IDEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLLAR officials on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid trip, and IDEN A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration received for the journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with IDEN G and his deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDEN G indicated at that time he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access in Key West.

8. Later, IDEN A told IDEN G he had sent lots of reports, but there had been no arrests, and therefore no bonuses. IDEN A said he would no longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to make IDEN A a LNCOLLAR consultant to protect his retired status. He also promised IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and agent payoffs. IDEN G also spoke of using IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on any of these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its request) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami area. Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A's name, and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner. Included in this group are IDEN O, IDEN P, and IDEN Q.

9. In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a party and, while drunk, said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLLAR activities. In June he made similar comments while at another social gathering. IDEN A made no comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). When IDEN A was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying only they would be aware of IDEN A's LNCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974, IDEN F said he knew IDEN A was working with LNCOLLAR. In July 1974, IDEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDEN A's handling officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an LNCOLLAR officer. IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too cumbersome. In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact, IDEN I.

10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West on which IDEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted

from a direct approach to the violators by LNCOLLAR officer IDEN E, who had come to Key West unbeknownst to IDEN A. Through friends in Miami, IDEN A found out IDEN E was in charge of IDEN A's operation in Key West, had a homosexual relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years (and was responsible for the breakup of IDEN E's first marriage), had big real estate deals going in Miami, had a Swiss bank account, and was still using BKHERALD cover in Miami.

11. IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN E's LNCOLLAR connection, and two other LNCOLLAR assets in the Miami area, had agreed to assist LNCOLLAR only if LNCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of their relationship or see any of their informant reports. IDEN I arranged for this through IDEN G, and the three agents' files were placed in IDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequently has learned IDEN E routinely saw all of IDEN P's reports. Later, when the revelations in the preceding paragraph were known, IDEN I told IDEN A there were many allegations about IDEN E, and that he had mentioned this to IDEN G. IDEN G had assured him he would be brought to Washington to discuss the matter, but nothing ever came of it. Ironically, IDEN E was taken into LNCOLLAR on the orders of LNCOLLAR Director IDEN R, and it was specified that no clearance or background check would be undertaken on him.

12. IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN F to learn more about IDEN E. During a one hour discussion, IDEN F said he had been appointed the recruiting officer within BKHERALD for persons who would go to LNCOLLAR. IDEN F said he had known IDEN E for a long period of time, and had brought him along in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F also engineered the absence of a security check on IDEN E by LNCOLLAR since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E revealed. At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what had been learned, including IDEN F's admission that IDEN E had told him IDEN A was an LNCOLLAR asset. IDEN G denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would check on IDEN E. IDEN A met with IDEN G the next day in Miami to fill him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. In the meantime, IDEN F told IDEN E of his meeting with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN E wrote a memorandum saying a fellow LNCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over-stepped the bounds of propriety in his relationship with an LNCOLLAR asset (IDEN A), and that IDEN I and IDEN A were running an investigation on IDEN E. IDEN E described the situation as "intolerable". The LNCOLLAR inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in discussing an LNCOLLAR employee with an asset. The Internal Affairs section of LNCOLLAR did continue the IDEN E probe and concluded by May 1975 that the charges against IDEN E were accurate. In the meantime, IDEN I was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship with IDEN A.

13. In August 1975, IDEN G informed IDEN A that control of his operation was being transferred to the Miami regional office, and that his financial relationship with LNCOLLAR would be terminated and then re-established locally following 1 September 1975. On 9 September 1975, a state-federal task force arrested 39 persons in Key West. IDEN A knew nothing about the arrests in advance. He called IDEN G to find out what was happening, and IDEN G said he also was unaware of them. He asked IDEN A to continue reporting on these developments. The next day IDEN A met with a source who told him someone had blown IDEN A's LNCOLLAR affiliation to the drug ring. He described the leak as coming from an ex-BKHERALD officer who hated IDEN A. IDEN A's source, who was in touch with drug ring members, told IDEN A the codename of his LNCOLLAR operation (IDEN S), and IDEN A learned IDEN F had spread this word all over town. IDEN A subsequently received telephone death threats (one of the ring member's girl friend called to tell him a white LNCOLLAR informant (IDEN A) would not get out of town alive). There had been eight informant deaths in Monroe County (Key West) in 1975, all unsolved murders. There was every reason, then, to take the threats seriously. IDEN A informed LNCOLLAR about the threats. LNCOLLAR replied that IDEN A was pushing the panic button, and asked for more information. IDEN A requested that the emergency evacuation apparatus be used, but LNCOLLAR refused. Finally, LNCOLLAR said "We don't know what you expect us to do since you've been terminated". IDEN A, who had been terminated by LNCOLLAR/Washington, had not been picked up subsequently by the Miami Regional Office.

14. IDEN A, desiring to keep a low profile, could not talk to many of his agents in Key West, but the few he did reach were expecting a portion of the reward money since the ring that was rolled up was one the agents had reported on for many months. IDEN A checked with LNCOLLAR on this, and was informed his net's information was not used as the basis for the arrests. IDEN A learned that IDEN F had passed the word around Key West that IDEN A was not an LNCOLLAR staff employee, which made IDEN A fair game for removal. He also learned plans had been made locally for his murder. At that point, IDEN A then made his escape with his wife. In Miami, he met with IDEN M. IDEN M claimed IDEN E had not caused any of the problems IDEN A had experienced. Concerning money assurances, IDEN M first denied any promises had been made. Later he said any that had been made (by IDEN G) were unauthorized. He reiterated IDEN A's reporting, although accurate, was not used in the arrests. LNCOLLAR agreed to provide IDEN A with US$1800 for all his problems, and raised the sum later to US$3 thousand. IDEN A accepted the money, but did not indicate he was satisfied with this sum.

15. IDEN A snuck back into Key West and packed his household goods in one evening. His boat was given to a fish supply house to sell. Since he owed the company money for supplies he had purchased, the fish house

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 6

sold the boat for a sum equal to his debts. IDEN A's wife quit her job without notice, and he estimates his actual financial losses are US$25 thousand. LNCOLLAR has indicated the US$3 thousand payment is "all IDEN A will get", and he is determined to get more.

16. IDEN A believes many of his agents think he did receive a payoff from LNCOLLAR following the arrests, and that he took all the money and ran, leaving them exposed in Key West. The cars of two of his agents were burned, and IDEN D, IDEN P, and others in the Miami area quit working for LNCOLLAR when they learned of the treatment he had received and/or received death threats themselves. IDEN T. As a result, IDEN A cannot return to Key West, and his lobster business no longer exists.

17. The purpose of IDEN A's contacting the BKHERALD is first to let us know what has happened to many of its former employees and assets. IDEN A believes BKHERALD should know of the false promises that were used to lure some BKHERALD employees to work at LNCOLLAR. As documentation, he provided IDEN I's grievance letter to LNCOLLAR which is attached* and for retention. IDEN I has, incidentally, been taken out of the Intelligence Division of LNCOLLAR and placed in enforcement work in Miami. IDEN I is currently seeking to return to BKHERALD employment, and IDEN A says IDEN I will verify his statements on the treatment of BKHERALD personnel who transferred to LNCOLLAR. (IDEN I's home phone in Miami is IDEN I.) He and the other ex-BKHERALD employees working at a lower level are fed up with LNCOLLAR, and are convinced they will never receive fair treatment in that organization. Since IDEN A believes the recruitment of BKHERALD officers to switch to LNCOLLAR will be a continuing thing, he feels we should know the realities of life in LNCOLLAR.

*[Forwarded Separately]

18. In addition, he notes LNCOLLAR is using many retired BKHERALD people and former BKHERALD assets in its activities. IDEN A believes these persons, in many instances, are being both used and abused. Any flap which occurs as a result of LNCOLLAR mismanagement will bounce back on BKHERALD, since it appears BKHERALD is involved in the LNCOLLAR operation. Indeed, IDEN G has given the impression his activities have been cleared with and approved by BKHERALD. Those assets who are being turned off by LNCOLLAR mismanagement are going to be lost to BKHERALD as well as to LNCOLLAR. Some of these persons could be significant assets in years to come.

19. A flap may not be so far off. In recent weeks IDEN U, who is writing a book about the role of the Cubans IDEN V and IDEN W in the IDEN X affair, called IDEN A and said he has information that IDEN G's wife and IDEN Y's business manager made a trip to Florida recently. Also IDEN U said he has learned that a former BKHERALD man who is a

14-00000

NFL-002-76
PAGE 7

LNCOLLAR agent is a homosexual, and that US$15 thousand in LNCOLLAR funds were given to someone in Miami to bail out a Puerto Rican drug dealer. The investigation of IDEN E by LNCOLLAR internal affairs did reveal, according to IDEN A, that US$15 thousand could not be accounted for by IDEN E, whose career appears to have been unaffected by the investigation. IDEN U, who obviously has a source within LNCOLLAR, also told IDEN A about many of the individuals (by name) in LNCOLLAR who are formerly BKHERALD employees.

20. IDEN U's information appears to be accurate, according to IDEN A, who recalls receiving a telephone call from IDEN G in July 1975. IDEN G was agitated, and asked IDEN A to handle a matter for him quickly and quietly. He said his wife, children, and the business agent of IDEN Y were in Key West, and were supposed to stay in the apartment of a retired BKHERALD employee named IDEN Z (formerly with IDEN AA). IDEN Z, a friend of IDEN F, had left the area and gave his apartment key to IDEN F. When IDEN G's wife and the others arrived in Key West, they could not locate IDEN F to get the key. IDEN G asked IDEN A to find out what they were doing, "and just how far my neck is stuck out". IDEN A learned they had checked into a local motel. He called IDEN G and passed on this information. IDEN G was relieved, but asked IDEN A to keep an eye on them and report their movements to him. Subsequently, while on a trip to Miami, IDEN A was approached by an LNCOLLAR officer in Internal Affairs. This individual said the episode was under active investigation, and asked IDEN A what he knew about it.

21. Finally, IDEN A is giving BKHERALD an opportunity to provide whatever advice, guidance, and assistance it wishes to furnish before he takes further action to obtain just compensation from LNCOLLAR. He is thinking in terms of possible BKHERALD intervention on his behalf with LNCOLLAR. He recognizes BKHERALD may wish to let him fend for himself. In that event, he plans to approach IDEN BB in Tampa to reveal the above story, and seek IDEN BB's assistance in petitioning LNCOLLAR for financial relief. He will not take any action with IDEN BB until he has heard from BKHERALD. Since he is anxious to get started on this matter, a speedy reply to his request for assistance will be appreciated.

22. IDEN A, incidentally, has decided to remain in Tampa, and has obtained a job as chief investigator for a local private security service. We indicated a reply would be forthcoming either through us or directly to IDEN A. His phone number is IDEN A. He resides at IDEN A.

SUBJECT: IDEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee

1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BKHERALD staff employee, on 7 January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A spoke for several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is a long summation of his comments, and at the memo's conclusion his reasons for bringing this situation to our attention. [Forwarded under Separate Cover].

In late 1973, a former BKHERALD asset (AMTABY Project) who had been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, came to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug traffic. He asked IDEN A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he was retired and could not help. A few months later, IDEN D (AMTABY-27), another former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed him LNCOLLAR had sent him down to check on IDEN C. IDEN D identified his LNCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff employee, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being staffed with BKHERALD employees in its Intelligence Division, and that the leader of the division was IDEN G, another BKHERALD staffer.
