The Chairman. The hearing will please come to order.

Mr. Bundy, would you please stand and take the oath.

Do you swear that the testimony you will give in this
hearing will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

Mr. Bundy. I do.

The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz.

TESTIMONY OF McGEORGE BUNDY

Mr. Schwarz. Would you state your full name and address
for the record, please?

Mr. Bundy. My name is McGeorge Bundy. I live in New
York. My home address is 1040 Fifth Avenue.

Mr. Schwarz. And you are currently the Chairman or the
President of the Ford Foundation?

Mr. Bundy. The President of the Ford Foundation.

Mr. Schwarz. In the Kennedy Administration what position
did you hold?

Mr. Bundy. I was Special Assistant for National Security Affairs.

Mr. Schwarz. And you held that all the way through the
Kennedy Administration and for how many years in the Johnson
Administration?

Mr. Bundy. I held that office from the beginning of the
Kennedy Administration to the end of February 1966.

Mr. Schwarz. Prior to commencing work with the Kennedy

Administration, had you had anything to do with the Central
Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Bundy. I had a brother who worked for many years in
the Central Intelligence Agency. I occasionally talked with
members of the Agency during the forties and the fifties, both
about substantive questions of what one thought about the
conditions in the Soviet Union, and occasionally also about
efforts that they were then making to recruit talented
graduates of colleges.

Mr. Schwarz. You mentioned your brother. To put something of a different kind in the record than we have gotten
recently, would you recount the position taken by Allan Dulles
in connection with the problem that your brother had in the
1950's.

Mr. Bundy. Well, my brother came under attack from
Senator Joseph McCarthy. And the ground was, as I recall
it, in general that he had been a friend and supporter of
Alger Hiss and was therefore not to be trusted in a place
as sensitive as the Central Intelligence Agency.

Allan Dulles -- and my impression is that this was
quite characteristic of him -- took an extremely firm stand
on this matter, and stood by his estimate that my brother was
in fact in no sense a security risk, rather to the con-
trary. And the defense was successful, and my brother
continued in the Central Intelligence Agency until the Kennedy

Administration came in, at which time he moved over to the
Defense Department.

Mr. Schwarz. We have indicated to you that we are going
to discuss the countries of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, although not much on Vietnam. And the majority and
minority staff have shown you some documents of that period,
some 15 years ago. Before I get to those three countries,
I would like to ask you some questions about a subject
called Executive Action. Have you ever heard of the
subject called Executive Action?

Mr. Bundy. Yes, I have.

Mr. Schwarz. When did you first hear of it?

Mr. Bundy. Well, as I have told your staff, that is a real
difficulty for me, because I cannot pinpoint the time at
which I heard of it. My impression was that it was some time
in the early months of 1961.

Mr. Schwarz. And do you have a recollection as to the
context in which you heard about it, the person from whom you
heard about it, and will you provide to the Committee your
full recollection of the subject of Executive Action in the
early 1961?

Mr. Bundy. Would it help if I try to describe in a
general way what I now understand of this matter, the
part which is recollection and the part which is clarified
by discussions with the staff and what I now think about it?

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

Mr. Schwarz. Would you distinguish, though, the part
that is recollection and the part that is based upon other
matters?

Mr. Bundy. That is exactly what I would like to do.

The part that is recollection is very vague. And I
would say that I have no recollection of more than one conver-
sation on this subject. And the impression that sticks in
my mind is that I was told about it in a general way. And
it was described to me as an effort to study through the
possibilities by which one might act against an individual
in a context other than that of espionage and counter-espionage,
a context more political.

Mr. Schwarz. When you say "act against an individual",
act in what fashion?

Mr. Bundy. Act in a variety of fashions, as I recollect
it, but up to and including killing the individual.

The two things that I think are clear in my recollection
about that -- three -- one, that it was a concept presented
or described to me -- I was in effect being briefed on it.

Two, that it was entirely an untargetted -- that it
was in no sense a plan to do anything to anyone.

And third, and I think quite important, that it was
not an operation which had any specific target.

Mr. Schwarz. You said you were in effect briefed on it.
By whom?

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

Mr. Bundy. That is what I don't know. I cannot
recollect who it was. And I think it inappropriate to guess
when I have no recollection.

Mr. Schwarz. What time? I don't mean what time of day,
but what time?

Mr. Bundy. As I say, sometime I think in the early
months of 1961. And searching memory is an uncertain busi-
ness, but it sticks in my mind that I heard about it in the
rooms of the Executive Office Building. And that
would place it in time, because I moved from the Executive
Office Building to the West Basement of the White House sometime
after the Bay of Pigs, perhaps in May.

Mr. Schwarz. So based on that fact you place it in
time sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs and sometime after--

Mr. Bundy. After my arrival in Washington.

Mr. Schwarz. And when did you arrive in Washington?

Mr. Bundy. About the 10th of January. I would place
it more closely, because I think it was after I was in the
office of the Special Assistant, which, of course, was occupied
until the 20th of January by others.

Mr. Schwarz. So you place it after the 20th of January,
but before the Bay of Pigs, which was April 14 or 17?

Mr. Bundy. That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. Did it come up in a context where you
urged that such a capacity be created?

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

Mr. Bundy. No.

Mr. Schwarz. What context did it come up in?

Mr. Bundy. It came up in a context in which it was being
described to me by someone else. And that is really about
as far as I can take it with precision.

Mr. Schwarz. Was it described to you by someone else
as a capacity in being?

Mr. Bundy. As a capacity -- and this is not something
I want to be too certain about, Mr. Schwarz, but my recollec-
tion would be that it was a capacity coming into being.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, receiving that information, did you
take any steps to discourage or dissuade the person, whoever
it was, who was describing to you the capacity coming
into being?

Mr. Bundy. What I recollect is that I was satisfied with
the description I received on two points.

First, that this was not an operational activity, and
would not become such without two conditions: first, that
there be a desire or a request or a guidance that there
should be planning against some specific individual; and
second, that there should be a decision to move against an
individual.

Being satisfied that these two things were not happen-
ing -- and I am now giving you a reconstruction rather than
a precise recollection -- I am confident that what I did was

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

to place this notion in the category of hypotheticals, of
things with no current urgency to them, and in that sense
not a question that cried for attention in the sense that
so many others did. If I may make a straightforward compari-
son, we were, I think, even before the inauguration, but
certainly very quickly thereafter, very heavily engaged in
a real question of choice, which was the question of choices
around what would you do with the Cuban brigade which led
eventually to the Bay of Pigs. And that occupied a very
large amount of time and attention, as did the crisis in Berlin
and the crisis in Laos.

In the same period there were briefings on contingency
plans for the uses of nuclear weapons, other weapons, and a
whole swarm of, sort of, and here were reports that came
naturally to the Special Assistant's office, which was also
being reorganized.

So, I think that what I did was simply to put this one
aside. I cannot claim to have thought about it seriously,
because it was in the flow of business that would come to the
Special Assistant's office.

Mr. Schwarz. I want to see if we can be more precise
on dates to check on what other evidence we have. We have
other evidence that discussions of this matter were going
on in the Central Intelligence Agency on the 25th and 26th
of January 1961.

Now, are you able to testify with respect to the likeli-
hood of the conversation you have recounted taking place
prior to the 25th or the 26th of January 1961.

Mr. Bundy. I would rate it very, very unlikely.
This is a matter I have thought about since you did mention
those dates to me. And I would say that the chance that
within the first four days after being sworn in I would have
been drawn to consider this question is, from my side, as
near zero as I can put it. I had been teaching international
relations over a period of ten years. I was deeply interested
in many of the immediate problems, most notably the problem of
the crisis in Berlin and the concomitant question of relations
with the Soviet Union. And I was preoccupied with all of
the things that happened when you moved to Washington from
helping the Secretary to buy a house, and working out a
staff, and I was under instruction from the President to
reorganize the White House National Security staff. This
subject was far out of my mind, and I would not have brought
it up. I doubt that anyone would have brought it to
me in those early days.

The Chairman. May I interrupt for a moment.

As I understand your testimony, Mr. Bundy, you were
briefed on the concept of Executive capability sometime early
in 1961, and you can't remember now who it was who briefed you.

Do you recall whether or not you instructed anyone at

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

the CIA to develop such a capability?

Mr. Bundy. I am sure I gave no instruction. But it is
only fair to add that I do not recall that I offered any
impediment after I was briefed.

The Chairman. But your best recollection is that some-
body told you that such a capability was being developed?

Mr. Bundy. I don't want to be too firm on that, but that
would be my best recollection.

The Chairman. We received testimony from Mr. Bissell.
Are you acquainted with Mr. Bissell?

Mr. Bundy. Yes, sir. I have known him a long time, and
he has been a great friend of mine.

The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz, since you are very familiar
with the record, are you going to take Mr. Bundy through the
record of Mr. Bissell's testimony?

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissell testified --

The Chairman. And we have the transcript. If it would
be helpful for Mr. Bundy to look directly at the transcript,
I think he should have it.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissell's testimony was, first, that
in the first instance he said he did not recall any specific
conversation. Then, however, he said, after having reviewed
certain notes by Mr. Harvey, he concluded that if Mr. Harvey's
note indicated, as they did, that he, Bissell, told Harvey
in 1961 that he had been twice urged by the White House to set

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

up an Executive Action capability, then he had no reason to
doubt that testimony. And then he went on through a series
of comments to end up saying that he would have been given
that urging by either Rostow or Bundy, more likely Rostow.
First, let's focus on Rostow. Was Rostow involved in
the briefing?

Mr. Bundy. No -- now, that I can't tell you out of my
recollection, but only out of my knowledge of the way the
office was organized. The first things we did, Walt Rostow
and I, was to work out an informal but nevertheless reasonably
clear-cut division of labor. And the whole business of
what I thought of as special group business, namely, matters
that related to covert action, and would, if they came for
division, come through the special group, fell on my side
of that division. I don't recall that Mr. Rostow was ever
involved in any matter of this sort.

The Chairman. It is fair to say that this was Mr. Rostow
testimony.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissell is, as you say, a friend of
yours of long standing, and still is a friend of yours?

Mr. Bundy. Yes, he is.

Mr. Schwarz. We have his testimony which, while it did
have gradations within it, ended up saying that
he believed either you or Mr. Rostow urged him to set up the
Executive Action capability. And you have testified that the

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

fact is that you were given a briefing, and you didn't urge it,
but on the other hand you didn't say it should stop.
How can you explain, if you can, the testimony of your
friend Mr. Bissell, and the contrast between that and
your testimony?

Mr. Bundy. Well, as I understand Mr. Bissell’s testi-
mony -- and I should add, so that there will be no misunder-
standing, that I have not only the advantage of discussions with
you, but I have talked with him about it -- as I understand
that testimony from that conversation, he was trying to ex-
plain a situation in which he had no reason to question an agency
history to the effect that he first gave instructions on this
matter in February 1961. And in that context -- and he had
no reason to question the report that he had received
White House encouragement -- it is in that context that his
speculations about Mr. Rostow and about me seem to fall.

I would be surprised, if his memory were refreshed
with respect to the dates of January which you have des-
cribed to me, if he were to believe that any initiative in
this enterprise would come in the first instance from the
Kennedy Administration.

The Chairman. Mr. Bundy, our transcript of the
Bissell testimony makes it clear that Mr. Bissell himself
does not dispute the documented record. He said in effect,
if Harvey says that I told him that I had been twice instructed

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

by the White House to develop an Executive capability, I
have no basis on which to dispute that record.

Then when we asked him, very well, who in the White
House told you, and when were you told, he replied, it
must have been early in 1960, and I don't recall who told me,
but it must have been either Rostow or Bundy.

He then recounts that he had numerous conversations
with both of you during the period, and concludes that the
instruction must have come either from you or from Mr. Rostow.
Now, Mr. Rostow tells us he never gave such an instruc-
tion, and in fact has no memory of every having discussed
such an instruction.

Mr. Bundy. He would have in fact have had no authority
to give such an instruction.

The Chairman. That is right. And he pointed that out.

Mr. Bundy. And in fact I wouldn't have the authority
to give any such instruction, and I would have been only
the channel to give such instruction.

Senator Baker. Who would have had the authority?

Mr. Bundy. If the authority were required outside the
Agency it would have to have been the President himself.

The Chairman. What I would like to ask you --

Mr. Bundy. Could I continue with Senator Baker's
question for one second.

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

My own impression as to this matter -- and I have already
testified to the fact that I am relying on a recollection of
a meeting of which there is no record -- is that had I been
briefed on this essentially hypothetical internal, undirected
character, it did not appear to me to be a matter that required
further authority outside the CIA. That may or may not have
been right, but that is the quick judgment I appear to have
reached. Because I certainly did not raise the question with
others.

Senator Baker. Do you recall that, Mr. Bundy, or is that
your surmise?

Mr. Bundy. That is my reconstruction more than my --
I know I did not raise it, I did not press the question, and
I did not feel, therefore, that it was a question that needed
further analysis, and it did not, so far as I know, get
further consideration in the White House. My own recollection
is that I didn't hear the words again in any serious con-
text that I can recall until this year.

The Chairman. And you cannot recall who it was who
briefed you?

Mr. Bundy. I really cannot.

Mr. Schwarz. Can you narrow the field?

Mr. Bundy. I can narrow the field. It would have to have
been a senior officer at the Agency, or someone with previous
understanding in the White House. I have no reason to suppose

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

that it was the latter, but I cannot exclude that.

The Chairman. Might it have been Bissell himself?

Mr. Bundy. It surely might have been.

The Chairman. Based upon your best recollection of that
briefing, you have already testified that you interpose no
objection?

Mr. Bundy. I am pretty sure I satisfied myself as to
the character of the enterprise. But I did not interpose an
objection.

The Chairman. Do you recall, then, having reported the
briefing to the President?

Mr. Bundy. No, I don't.

The Chairman. Did it strike you -- before I ask that
question, based upon your best recollection of the briefing,
were you told that this was a new capability that was being
developed, or were you told simply that the Agency possessed
such a capability?

Mr. Bundy. I would put it that the Agency was working on
such a capability, but without any great sense of precision.

The Chairman. Were you given the impression at
that briefing that the Agency was seeking your authority or
the authority of the White House?

Mr. Bundy. I think they were testing my reaction, as
I now look back on it. But I do not recall that they were
seeking authority. If it had come to me as a matter of White

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

House authority, I know from the context -- my own concept
of my job what I would have done.

The Chairman. What would you have done?

Mr. Bundy. I would have had to take the matter to the
President, because I had no independent authority.

The Chairman. And you have testified that you did not
take the matter to the President?

Mr. Bundy. As far as I can recall, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Well, this is a subject dealing, as it
does, with the development of a capability to kill that would
have been of the character that if you had been asked for
authority you would have discussed with the President?

Mr. Bundy. That is right.

The Chairman. And furthermore, is it not a subject of
a character that you would be very likely to recall?

Mr. Bundy. If I had been asked for authority I would
recall it. If I were the initiating or deciding agent, I
would recall that I had had that role.

You speak of the seriousness of it. It deals with a
capability to kill. One of the sobering facts about coming
into the government from outside into a sensitive position
like that one is the number of things on which you are briefed
which deal with the capability to kill. Contingency plans
for protecting West Berlin, contingency plans for the use of
nuclear weapons -- shelf plans, a shade more remote, perhaps,

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

for the use of different kinds of gases -- an operational plan
for the invasion of Cuba -- these were uncertainties as to
whether there would have to be military landings in Laos. In
the context of 1961 -- and I am not in any sense trying to un-
derstate the seriousness of the context of 1975 -- this was a
hypothetical kind of a thing with two strong locks between
it and any decision. And I simply didn't pay it the attention
then that we are paying to it now. We are right to pay
that attention now.

The Chairman. I understand that very well. And this
Committee is endeavoring in every way it can to place this
whole issue within the context of the time. Nevertheless, we
are faced with a very real dilemma. We know that at the very
time you were being briefed the Agency was not only interested
in developing a capability, but was in fact engaged in a
series of attempts to assassinate Castro, and had been in-
volved in other murder plots and murder attempts against the
leaders of certain foreign governments.

The question we are endeavoring to answer is whether
the Agency had been authorized by the policy makers of the
government to engage in this activity, or whether it was
operating fast and loose on a wild gambit of its own in an
area of extreme sensitivity that could have the most serious
repercussions upon the government of the U.S. and its
reputation in the world.

---

WARD & PAUL

We are told by Mr. Bissell, who apparently was not only
a very good friend of yours, but also a very good friend of Mr.
Rostow's --

Mr. Bundy. That is right.

The Chairman. -- a man whose credibility as a witness
would seem to have to be respected -- that he was at least
engaged in developing such a capability on direct instructions
from the White House.

But when we pressed him for specifics, his testimony
becomes very vague. He can't remember just who it was who
told him, he can't dispute the record, which says that in effect
he so advised Mr. Harvey when he engaged Mr. Harvey to develop
the capability. And everyone else of high authority in
the Administration that we have questioned so far testifies
that it was not the policy of the Administration to engage in
assassination, and no such attempts were ever authorized,
and indeed, with the exception of one occasion in the Special
Group, the subject never even surfaced for discussion.
And when it did, if it did, it was quickly shot down.
Nevertheless, the CIA was in fact embarked upon such
attempts during the period under review.

Now, we are led to conclude either that we are not
being told the truth concerning the policy of the Administra-
tion, which is very hard for me to accept, given the reputation of
the witnesses that have come before us, for integrity and

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

truthfulness, or that the CIA was running wild, and acting on
its own initiative, engaging in murder plots, murder attempts,
and not informing, let alone securing the authority from,
those in government who held the responsibility, which in a way
is even more frightening.

Now, you tell us that you remember being briefed. You
don't remember advising the President. It didn't seem too
important at the time. Did you ever follow-up on whether such
a capability had in fact been perfected by the agency?

Mr. Bundy. I don't recall pursuing the matter at all,
Mr. Chairman, any more than I would have pursued any other
shelf capability on which no question was being pushed to me,
either from below or above.

If I may go back and comment on one aspect of your,
I think, important and impressive description of
the difficulty the Committee faces, I am sure that if in the
early months of 1961 I had known what I now know, in part from
the newspapers and in part from discussions with your staff,
about what was really in train, I would have had a very
different approach.

Senator Mondale. Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Senator Mondale.

Senator Mondale. Yesterday Secretary Rusk testified be-
fore us. And some of the minutes or notes made following one
of themeetings of the Special Group Augmented at least suggest

---

WARD & PAUL
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

that the question of assassination occurred. And, Mr. Rusk
said, did you think anyone would bring that up at a town
meeting? And by that I gather he meant that these meetings
had large attendance from all different groups and prinicples
and staff assistants and so on, and as a result, if there
were matters of exceeding delicacy, that was not the forum
at which such matters would be discussed.

Would you comment on that?

Mr. Bundy. Yes. My impression would be that the
Secretary was probably referring to the much discussed meeting
of August 10, 1962.

Senator Mondale. Right.

Mr. Bundy. That was a large meeting, 16 or 18 people.
And the comment seems to be pertinent to that meeting. The
Special Group as such, the one which I would have had in
mind, for example, in early 1961, was set up under a national
security regulation of some sort whose number was 54/12.

Senator Mondale. That was the Special Group?

Mr. Bundy. That was the Special Group. And the Special
Group in and of itself was quite a small group.

Senator Mondale. But people would volunteer to attend --

Mr. Bundy. No.

Senator Mondale. They would not?

Mr. Bundy. No. The meeting of August 10 is a very
special meeting in a variety of respects. That included --

The Chairman. You were present at that meeting?

Mr. Bundy. I was present. My memory is entirely
a refreshed memory on this, I had no recollection of the
meeting until recent months. But I have found a scratch
pad that I apparently doodled on on that date, and it
shows who was there, and not much else.

Mr. Schwarz. There were some beautiful drawings.

Mr. Bundy. There were. They were not very beautiful drawings.

The Special Group Augmented met in August -- and this
does coincide with my general recollection of the matter --
in response to concerns which were first, I think, and most
energetically pressed by Mr. McCone with respect to, what the

complexity which was put out toward the end of August, most
of which dealt with this question, how do we know what they
are going to do, what do we do if they do it, and so forth,
with respect to missiles in Cuba.

It was therefore in a sense much more than an ordinary
MONGOOSE meeting, let alone a Special Group meeting. And
while I quite agree with the Secretary that that meeting as
a planning session for anything as horrendous as assassina-
tion is implausible in the extreme. Quite serious covert

actions were discussed in the Special Group. And as your
committee pursues its studies of covert action it will find
that that group is the nodal point for policy decisions, good
or bad, well or badly handled. And that was quite a small
group.

Senator Mondale. The reason I ask that is that it seems
to me that the Chairman's question pursues the two alternatives,
either what we now know to have occurred was ordered at the
highest level, or at a very high level, such as the Special
Group Augmented, or they operated on their own, in which case
they were out of control and irresponsible, or there
