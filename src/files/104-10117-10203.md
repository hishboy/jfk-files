from Chief, Central Cover Group concerning the threat of exposure of Agency operations and concludes that the BROWN Foundation of Houston, Texas was one of the most vulnerable to exposure because public records reflect direct ties from Agency funding instruments identified by Congressman PATMAN in 1964 to legitimate foundations and Agency projects they have sponsored.

VERNON FUND *** 69000-573

The VERNON Fund (HERJUDICED) was created by the Agency in June 1958 as an ostensibly private philanthropic foundation legally incorporated under the laws of and with an office in the District of Columbia. It is used as a cover and funding mechanism for Project DALAMPREY. The objectives of this project is the development of organizational and individual assets capable of strengthening the unity of non-Communist teachers and their organizations throughout the world. These objectives are carried out through the active support by the Agency of the international programs of the National Education Association (NEA/INTERN) and the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP/JELACIEPOD) with which NEA is affiliated. In 1967 because of exposure of the Vernon Fund in news media, the Board members were contacted and advised as follows:

World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Professions (Funded by Vernon Fund)

In April 1967 a discussion was held between an Agency representative and Jim WIL and May S of the WCOTP (World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession) concerning future funding for WCOTP. Because of publicity concerning the funding of WCOTP by the Vernon Fund, WCOTP leadership promised its membership that no further Vernon Fund money would be accepted until the status of the Vernon Fund was clarified. John THOMPSON felt that the best solution would be a one-time only infusion of money by sterile check into the WCOTP bank account to be backstopped by a letter from the attorney for the Vernon Fund, Bryce REA, who would attribute the money to members of the Vernon Fund Board who anonymously wished to provide WCOTP with sufficient funds to cover expenses until other sources could be found.

In May 1967 John THOMPSON of the WCOTP described to an Agency representative an interview he had with Mike McMANUS of TIME magazine on 1 May 1967 who wanted to discuss the effects of newspaper publicity on WCOTP operations. McMANUS was especially interested in any examples forced on WCOTP and a request for proof of the value of WCOTP operations to individual teachers. THOMPSON felt that McMANUS did not succeed in gaining sufficient additional information from the interview to merit writing his projected article.

American Friends of the Middle East (Project LITTMER) was created in 1951 with the purpose of employing aggressive means to promote the friendship of peoples of the Near and Middle East toward the United States and to combat Communism. It was incorporated as a voluntary, non-profit membership corporation under the laws of New York State. Dorothy THOMPSON, columnist, was selected as Chairman.

In early 1967 AFME received a good deal of newspaper publicity concerning its Agency affiliation including articles in the Soviet press, TASS and USSR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. Syria was the only country in which AFME is active that raised the question of the organization's continued existence in the light of allegations of Agency financial support although there were rumblings in Iraq.
