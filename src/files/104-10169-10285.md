A reliable source advised that Richard
Cyril FRANK arrived at the Ottawa Airport on September
17, 1971 via Eastern Airlines flight 177 from the United

On his arrival at 9:35 a.m. he deposited his
three bags of luggage in a locker at the Airport, then
travelled to the People's Republic of China Embassy, 100
Bronson Ave., Ottawa by taxi; he remained at the Embassy
for five hours then returned to the Ottawa Airport.

FRANK arranged to be placed on stand-by for
Air Canada flight no. 459 to Toronto and at 4:40 p.m. he
departed on this flight.

While waiting at the Airport FRANK was over-
heard talking on a pay telephone. He mentioned to the
person he called that he was phoning long distance and
that he could be reached at 714-454-7126.

A photograph of FRANK taken on September 17,

AMERICAN LEFTISTS FLOCKING TO PEKING: Communist China has instituted its own Open Door
policy for American leftists, some of them with long-standing ties to Communist parties.
A reception in Peking early this month provided intelligence agencies with a partial
glimpse of who is welcome, and the relative pecking order. Turning out to be greeted by
Premier Chou En-Lai and his two top assistants, Kuo Mo-jo and Keng Piao, were about 70
Americans, some permanent Peking residents and government employees. Radio Peking listed
some by name, deliberately concealing the identity of others. Greeting Chou were "All
members of the delegation of Revolutionary Union" (RU is a fanatically pro-Mao armed revo-
lutionary group centered around Palo Alto and Richmond, Calif.), Pablo "Yoruba" Guzman,
head of the Young Lords Party, Black Panther's Huey Newton, Elaine Brown and Robert Bay,
and "16 American young people led by Mrs. Carmelita Hinton" (of Putney, Vt.). Also Mr.
& Mrs. Max Granich (brother of the late Communist writer Mike Gold), William Epton (ex-
member of Progressive Labor Party), Jack Belden (author of pro-Red China book), Mrs. Susan
Warren (an old CP and PLP functionary), Dick Frank (Mrs. Warren's husband), Mr. & Mrs.
Hoseah Williams (of Southern Christian Leadership Conference), Mr. & Mrs. John S. Service
(ex-State Department employee, recently "rehabilitated" by liberal press in U.S.) Mr. &
Mrs. William H. Hinton, Mr. & Mrs. Jack Schulman, Mr. & Mrs. Henry Wilcox, Dr. & Mrs.
Samuel Rosen, Mr. & Mrs. Victor W. Sidel, and Geoffrey Collins.

Among Peking residents present were: Frank and Ruth Coe, Sol and Pat Adler (Frank Coe and
Sol Adler were implicated in Soviet espionage in Washington in the '40s), Erwin Engst,
Joan Hinton (his wife, and a developer of U.S. and probably Red Chinese atomic bombs),
Bertha Sneck (ex-Mrs. William Hinton), Eleanor Chaidin, Julian Schuman (once indicted for
treason in Korean War), Norman Schulman, Sidney Shapiro, Ione Kramer, Betty Chang, Alice
E. Cheng, Lucille Stewart, Carmelita Hinton (the younger) and Fred Engst (name order un-
doubtedly is clue to rating).
