1. Forwarded herewith for Headquarters information and
files is an Agent Service Record on LIRING-3.

2. As Addressees are aware, Wallace P. ROWTON recruited
and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Mexico City Station.
Prior to ROWTON's PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,
it was decided, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of
LIRING-3, rather than terminate him. Although LIRING-3 apparently
had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintained
good contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of
Guatemala. In addition, in May and June of this year, he had
begun to develop access to some Panamanian revolutionaries of
interest. It was therefore decided to run LIRING-3 on a trial
basis to determine whether he could be used effectively against
Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with
the Cubans.

3. ROWTON introduced Leonard S. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3
on 1 July 1969. Although ROWTON had represented himself to LIRING-3
as a Greek businessman, it was decided that it would be preferable
to "clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY organization. Nonetheless, no specific explanation was given LIRING-3 of his sponsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told that TORMET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country
for an indefinite period.

4. LIRING-3 was told that although TORMET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the
past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,500.00 Mexican pesos
per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization felt that
1,500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) would be a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMET explained that he was aware
of LIRING-3's past activities directed against the Cubans, and the
resultant problems which had arisen. It was explained that
TORMET's interest was in Central American revolutionary activities.
In order to deal with LIRING-3's virtual "burned" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he therefore was no
longer directly involved with any revolutionary groups or activities.
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which
he could provide to any revolutionaries, on the basis of his
leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had made with FAR
members while in prison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-3 was completely
blacklisted in all revolutionary circles because of his problems
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.

5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits
and he seemed to accept the turnover without any qualms. Indeed,
he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to do by ROWTON which he had known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion. It was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this
stage all that could be done was to attempt to circumvent the
existing problems.

6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone
number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
a prearranged pickup point was decided upon. It should be noted
that TORMET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3.

7. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new
telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no
indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico
for at least three weeks after the 1 July turnover to TORMET.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, LIRING-3
has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
a RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never
very productive and now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break
off contact--it has been decided to make no effort to reestablish
contact with him.

24 September 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: WH/1 (Marvin Francis)

SUBJECT: 17 September 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL
re LIRING/3 & LIRING/4.

PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, KERBE, FRANCIS and Laurence
PIPER (C/WH/2/G).

1. LIRING/4 is still very concerned about the im-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 will not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the safety of LIRING/3. DRISCOLL
has thoroughly discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf.
Through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for
assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do.
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3
has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 not to let the Guats
transfer him to another prison as this usually ends in the
prisoner being shot "while escaping.” One good result
from the continued imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans.

2. L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Secre-
tary of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign
Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the
assassination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary
told L/4 there were three possibilities, the first which
he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be
shot, the second was that L/4 would come to trial and be
released within a few weeks, and the third was that he would
receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior to
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to arrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a
typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the
meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material
that she called the Cuban Embassy and informed them the

SECRET

-2-

Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Embassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL therefore, concluded she had not
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and night see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless scribble as a signature.

3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to
recontact L/4 to get the latest reading on L/3's status in
Guatemala. If the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's
release in behalf of the Mexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation can
become active again.

4. In the above regard L/3 was discussed with Mr. PIPER
of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has
a high enough contact with the Guats (ESMAJOR/20-Presidents
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Mexican compatriot out
of prison and back to Mexico with a minimum security risk.
DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon his return to
Mexico after he has talked with L/4. DRISCOLL felt he should
possibly travel to Guatemala and have a preliminary meet with
L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effort to officially
request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is satis-
fied that L/3 is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to
have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/
20 will arrange the release so that all involved believe it
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
ment. DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and L/4 to believe
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order
to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-
al tasks he will levy on them.

THIS IS AN INFORMATION REPORT, NOT FINALLY EVALUATED INTELLIGENCE

COUNTRY: Guatemala/Mexico REPORT NO: CS-MM-12,647
SUBJECT: Organization of the Guatemalan DATE DISTR: June (071)
Communist Party (PGT) in Mexico FIELD NO: Mexico, Mexico City (11 June 1971)

SOURCE: A member of the PGT who has good contacts with Guatemalan
Communists in Mexico. Much of the information which he
provided has been independently corroborated.

1. The highest ranking body of the Guatemalan
Communist Party (PGT) organization in Mexico is the
"Delegation of the Central Committee." This body con-
sists of Huberto Alvarado Arellano, Jose Alberto
Cardoza Aguilar, and Jose Luis Balcarcel
Ordenes. (Field Comments: CS-311/02973-70 (EXO-12,183),
from the EPO source in this report, reported on the make-
up of the PGT organization in Mexico as of April 1970.
Cardoza and Balcarcel made up the Delegation of the Central
Committee at that time. TICS-314/ -71 (RGG ), from
a reliable source, provided the information that Alvarado,
the Third Secretary of the PGT, planned to reside in Mexico
for the immediate future.)

2. Balcarcel also heads the "Directive Committee" of
the PGT organization in Mexico, which is responsible for
determining what activities the local PGT organization will
undertake and who will carry them out. The other members of
the "Directive Committee" are Alfonso Solorzano
Fernandez and Julio Rodriguez Aldana. (Source:
Consent: There has been no change in the membership of the
"Directive Committee" since April 1970. Although Rodriguez
assumes this leadership position, he has been relatively
inactive in PGT affairs.)

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

3. There are currently two active cells under the
guidance of the "Directive Committee:"
a. A "Propaganda Cell" headed by Carlos
Cacerez Ortiz, which also includes Solorzano
and Horacio Landa Castaneda; and
b. A "Finance Cell" headed by Rodriguez,
which also includes Vilma de Balcarcel,
Mercedes de Pereyra, and Carlos
Illescas Agurcia.

4. Ernesto Capuano del Vecchio, who was
formerly a member of the "Finance Cell," now works directly
under the "Directive Committee" and is not formally a
member of the "Propaganda Cell," submitted his resignation
from the PGT in April 1971. Raul Diaz Ramirez, who
was also formerly a member of the "Propaganda Cell," has
been temporarily separated from active participation in the
PGT.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

b. "Romulo," who made at least one trip "out
of town" from 17 February to 2 April 1969 (possibly
to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROWTON's
reports, appears to belong to a faction of the
Guatemalan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMEN.

c. The only real service asked LIRING-3 by
"Romulo" during the period under review was to put
up an unidentified "comrade" scheduled to come to
Mexico at a date which "Romulo" said he could not
determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young
Guatemalan who dropped in on LIRING-3 for a couple
of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.

d. LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence
that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a
suspicious element definitely not to be trusted (see
reports dated 15 and 19 February).

3. Several attempts to tail "Romulo" did not produce
particularly significant results. A pretext investigation of
apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila, where LIRING-3 met "Romulo,"
produced the results contained in the Spanish language report
dated 26 February forwarded as attachment #2. There were no
traces on the Ines BASTON de PIMENTEL family.

4. There is little question at this point that LIRING-3
is close to persona non grata with LIRING. Hence, his further
usefulness against the PBRUMEN target is very limited.
ROWTON has kept away from LIRING-4 since LIRING-3's release
from prison in Guatemala. Although LIRING-4, following her
father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother
in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN
authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the
Station is, as it has done many times in the past, waiting for
LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next move.

CONTACT REPORT

11 February, 1969

1. Agent: LIRING/3
2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1100, 11/2/69; Camino Real
3. Next Meeting: 1000, 14/2/69; same place.
4. Reports/Information Submitted by Agent:

LIRING/3 told Rowton that there had been little or no developments
since he last saw Rowton (21/1/69), just before Rowton had left on
his business trip to Monterrey. He commented that he had felt it
wiser not to take any initiative in seeking out his FAR friends or
revisiting the LIRING office until Rowton had returned. He stated
that his old Guatemalan friend, Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla, had called
on him once in the company of Carlos Vega, but nothing significant
had emerged from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points
in the conversation, had mumbled something to Rodriguez about the
"crisis" but neither gave an explanation. L/3 told Rowton that he as-
sumed that this remark referred to the current factionalism in the
Guatemalan revolutionary struggle.

LIRING/3 then identified the attached photo of Mario Augusto Mendez
Aguilar immediately at the first glance as that of "Rómulo", aka "Mario
Mendez" and "Pavel." LIRING/3 did not recognize the photo Rowton
showed him of Mario Otoniel Mendez Molina.

5. Guidance/Information Given to Agent:

Rowton told L/3 that according to the very sketchy information he
had concerning Mario Augusto Mendez Aguilar it appeared that the latter
belonged to a strongly anti-PBRUMEN faction and that this would perhaps
explain the turn-about of the LIRINGs after he, L/3, had indicated to
LIRING/9 that he was in contact with "Pavel."

Rowton urged L/3 to seek out "Rómulo" at the calle Coahuila 221 safe-
house, and, failing this
