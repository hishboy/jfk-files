ARE ORLANDO GARCIA, INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY ADVISER TO

CHIEF OF DISIP'S FOREIGN ESPIONAGE DIVISION.

ALL THREE OF THESE

MEN WERE ORIGINALLY CUBAN CITIZENS. (SOURCE COMMENT: GIFFUNI

DID NOT REVEAL THE EXACT NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE MEN.)

2. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CUBAN EXILES

ARE ATTEMPTING TO SMEAR THE THREE MEN, BECAUSE OF THEIR PART IN

ARRESTING CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORLANDO BOSCH AND LUIS

POSADA WHO HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE CUBANA CRASH.

NONETHELESS, ACCORDING TO GIFFUNI, LEPAGE HAS APPOINTED A SPECIAL

COMMISSION HEADED BY GIFFUNI TO INVESTIGATE THE CHARGES MADE

AGAINST THE OFFICIALS. GIFFUNI ALSO SAID THAT HE IS EXPLORING

THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCREETLY INFORMAING NORBERTO HERNANDEZ

CURBELO, CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO VENEZUELA, OF THE CUBAN EXILE CHARGES

AGAINST THE MEN AND HIS INVESTIGATION OF THE CASE. (FIELD COMMENT:

A CHANNEL BETWEEN GIFFUNI AND HERNANDEZ WAS INITIATED WHEN GIFFUNI

WAS DISIP DEPUTY CHIEF. SEE HVC-7380, TDFIRDB-315/04976-76, OF MID MAY,

FROM THE SAME SOURCE WHOSE RELIABILITY HAS BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY

UPGRADED. GIFFUNI HAS REASON TO HARBOR RESENTMENT

SINCE HE AND RIVAS WERE BITTER RIVALS INSIDE DISIP AND SINCE GARCIA AND

RIVAS REPLACED HIM AT DISIP. MORALES, IN TURN, IS CLOSELY

ASSOCIATED WITH GARCIA.)

FOR DISIP IN THE INTERIOR UNDER A FALSE NAME. (FIELD COMMENT:

MORALES REPORTEDLY WAS ORDERED OUT OF VENEZUELA WHEN DISCLOSURES

CONCERNING HIS ACTIVITIES BECAME EMBARRASSING TO THE VENEZUELAN

PISTOLEROS Y TERRORISTAS

HAN SIDO NACIONALIZADOS

Junto con Ricardo Morales Navarrete, alto funcionario en la Ofi-

cina de Fronteras (¡nada menos!) se nacionalizó y trabaja Antonio

Ignacio Bustillo Pérez, conocido pistolero traido de Miami por el

gang mercenario de Orlando Garcia, "ministro consejero", según

el pasaporte con el que hace frecuentes viajes al Caribe, México y

Estados Unidos con pasajes y viáticos oficiales

Como ya se ha informado, Ricardo

Morales Navarrete, asistente de Or-

lando Garcia en la Oficina de Fronte-

ras de nuestro pais en Caracas (edifi-

cio del "Banco del Caribe"; Dr. Paúl

Salvador de León, piso 11), fue nacio-

ñalizado venezolano el 25 de julio de

este año. Morales Navarrete llegó a

Venezuela como prófugo de la justicia

norteamericana (igual que Orlando

Bosch) desde Miami, según lo anuncia-

ron entonces diarios de los Estados

Unidos.

Con dos años de permanencia en el

pais ya es "ciudadano venezolano".

Lo curioso es que en la misma Gace-

ta Oficial de la República de Venezue-

la donde se concede la nacionalidad a

Morales Navarrete, cubano contrarre-

volucionario especializado en la coloca-

ción de bombas en Miami, donde estu-

vo arrestado en 1968 por esa causa,

también se otorga idéntico beneficio

al pistolero Antonio Ignacio Bustillo

Pérez, de igual origen y empleado co-

mo Morales Navarrete en la Oficina de

Fronteras.

El nombre Bustillo aparece en la Ga-

ceta justamente encima de Morales

Navarrete.

Según resolución de la Dirección Na-

cional de Identificación y Extranjeria y

por órdenes del ministro de Relaciones

Interiores (Dr. Octavio Lepage), de

acuerdo con la decisión suscrita por

Ramón Ignacio Velásquez B., director

del despacho mencionado arriba, se

produjo este insólito hecho.

AGENTES DE LA CIA

No somos nosotros quienes hacemos

la acusación de que importantes orga-

nismos de seguridad de Venezuela es-

tan infiltrados por la Agencia Central

de Inteligencia de los Estados Unidos,

entre ellos la DISIP y la Oficina de

Fronteras, una entelequía esta ultima

cuya función es remora, Hilda Inclán,

del diario "The Miami News", Taylor

Branch, de la revista "Esquire" y John

Rothchil, devueltos a los Estados Uni-

dos por un incidente en Maiquetia, afir-

maron que Morales Navarrete es agen-

te de la CIA y segundo oficial al man-

do de la inteligencia venezolana.

Fueron inútiles las aclaratorias del

MRI y otros despachos sobre estas acu-

saciones, puesto que Morales Navarre-

te continua trabajando en la Oficina

de Fronteras, con la salvedad de que

desde la denuncia pública de su caso

se cuida acercarse al edificio del "Ban-

co del Caribe", pero sabemos que está

operando desde otra parte.
