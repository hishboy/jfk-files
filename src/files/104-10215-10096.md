SUBJECT: Administrative Factors

ACTION REQUIRED: As Indicated

REFERENCES: (A) UFGT-135, dtd 29Oct60

(B) UFGT-150, dtd 4Nov60

1. Please advise Harold R. NOEMAYR that the hospitalization application forwarded via reference (A) is being processed, and the effective date of coverage is 27 November 1960.

2. Please advise Charles E. PARZON that his U. S. Savings Bonds will be retained in Headquarters pending his return. The Payroll Office handling PARZON's accounts has determined that this is a more secure method of making sure he receives them in person, rather than sending the bonds in care of the party indicated in reference (B).

3. Please advise DUEN A that as a result of the Proficiency Test he took while assigned locally, he obtained a Proficiency Score of 87. As the Minimum Proficiency Score for award of Proficiency Pay is 94, he is not eligible for the award of Proficiency Pay.

4. Forwarded under separate cover is another envelope containing copies of Travel Orders for personnel currently assigned JMASH and J-RIM.

5. Please advise Oliver H. CORBUSTON that the annual premium on his Specified Diseases policy is due 30 November 1960. The Family Plan for this policy is $10.00. Inasmuch as a grace period of one (1) month is granted, you may advise CORBUSTON to submit a check for the premium amount to Headquarters as soon as possible.

SUBJECT: Harold R. NOEMAYR

ACTION REQUIRED

1. It is requested that the attached application for Health Insurance be given to Harold R. NOEMAYR for completion. NOEMAYR may retain the covering memorandum which outlines his coverage. The completed forms should be returned to Headquarters for processing. The premiums will be deducted from NOEMAYR's salary. Headquarters will notify NOEMAYR when his policy is in effect.

2. Please explain to NOEMAYR that this plan covers basically two types of health insurance. 1: the normal hospitalisation explained in paragraph 3 of the attachment which includes in- and out-patient care, surgery and maternity. The allowable expenses covered under this section are immediately reimbursable within the limits of the plan. 2: the major medical benefit plan described in paragraph covers miscellaneous medical expenses not normally connected with hospitalization such as doctors' office visits, doctors' home visits, prescriptions, injections and medications given by doctors, X-rays and other laboratory work done in connection with diagnosis or treatment, etc. The insured pays up to $100 of such allowable expenses under this category for each member of his family. If expenses exceed this $100 for any person during the calendar year, then the policy will pay for 80% of their additional expenses. In connection with this phase of the plan, it is suggested that NOEMAYR be advised to have his family keep a detailed record of all medical expenses incurred by each member of the family.

3. NOEMAYR should be advised that under the hospitalization section of the plan, up to $75.00 can be reimbursed for surgical fees in connection with a tonsillectomy, whether the tonsillectomy is performed in a hospital or in the surgeon's offices.
