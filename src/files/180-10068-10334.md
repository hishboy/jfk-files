RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 9

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

December 21, 1978

Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on House Administration
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

One of the Committee's employees, Eileen G. Dinneen, used her annual and sick leave in July, 1978 for maternity reasons.

Upon her return to work on August 1, 1978, she elected to work 25% of her time at 25% of her previous salary.

On September 1, 1978, the amount was raised in both instances to 50%. And then on December 1, 1978, she returned to full-time status to assist the Committee on the final report.

While the action on December 1, 1978 was duly approved, through some error the Committee's budget officer was not informed. Consequently no payroll authorization form was processed to increase her salary.

I am now enclosing a payroll authorization form to correct this error by increasing her salary to the proper amount of $16,100.00.

I would appreciate your approving this new authorization so that Mrs. Dinneen will receive the additional amount due her in the December, 1978 supplemental payroll.

Cordially,

LOUIS STOKES
Chairman
