Special Group

OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though the U. S. could probably not get away with this either. A number of alternative base sites for the training of the Cubans was considered both in the United States, in Puerto Rico, or in the Panama Canal zone. Mr. Douglas felt the "U. S. capability for intervention in Cuba will probably not be effective enough unless there is more overt participation than has been contemplated to date."
"Mr. Grey supported this general position, stating that when the current Cuban plan was approved, the situation in that country was different than it is now. Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have organized a militia. Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be..."
"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or two-year wait..."

Lansdale states, "On October 30-31 for an 'Eyes Only' background memorandum requested by Roswell Gilpatric, information was requested from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba, although I asked for specifics on militant teams inside. Two action teams CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)"

*IN A hand-written note next to the above statement by Lansdale reads, "Harvey/Chever say he did not ask."*

OCCURRENCE:
According to the minutes of the 303 Committee on 7/30/64, "It was agreed that MR. FITZGERALD would contact SAM PAPICH of the FBI in regard to the earlier report of an alleged plot with Mafia overtones to assassinate Castro and which the AG agreed to handle as a matter of law enforcement." (116) The reference is clearly to a 6/10/64 memorandum information report from the DDP to the Director, (116) which was disseminated to the Spec. Asst. to the Pres. for Natl. Security Affrs.; Asst. Sect. for Inter-American Affairs, Dept. of State; Dir. of Intell. and Research, State Dept.; Director, DIA; The AG; the Director, FBI; DDCI and the DCI. The 6/10/74 report related a proposal for the assassination of Castro that was made to prominent Cuban exiles. The Mafia appeared to be involved in the scheme. The asking price was $150,000. JOSE MARIO PEPIN BOSCH, Preso of Bacardi Rum would contribute $50,000. BOSCH approached the Chief of Station, JMWAVE and suggested the U.S. government also contribute. This was rejected. The record indicates CIA's only involvement was to report information of its existence."

OCCURRENCE:
Efforts were made to establish contact with Juana Castro Ruz, half sister of Fidel and Raul Castro Ruz, because she opposed the strong Communist nature of the Cuban regime. According to Mrs. Virginia Leitao de Cunha, she contacted Ruz and obtained Ruz agreement to provide intelligence on the Cuban political leadership and to work against the Cuban Communist regime, "short of engaging in activity which might result in direct personal harm to her brothers Raul and Fidel." Arrangements were being made for direct recruitment of Ruz in Mexico.

OCCURRENCE:
SGA discussed various possibilities of accomplishing reconnaissance of Cuba, ranging from very low level coverage by tactical aircraft to high performance aircraft and drones. Overflights and peripheral flights were discussed.

It was agreed that the first priority is one high performance mission in the western part of the island, to be accompanied by all out Elint support. Depending on the results of this, a member of similar scarches may be mounted. First mission was later approved by higher authority, but the decision on the second proposition left open.

The entire package was to be discussed at the USIB, and by Chiefs on Wednesday, October 10th.

OCCURRENCE:
President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in Mexico. It fulfilled U.S. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the United States and the West. State believes this should ease the way for future discussions about Cuba with the Mexicans. Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by President Kennedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was 'They proposed to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of peoples." In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had agents in Havana operating. In addition there are agents and teams in the provinces. Voice of Cuba" broadcasts from the U.S. Navy submarine were successful. "It is noted that UPI carried this news item but spiced it up with added stories of Castro's use of militia against guerillas in Mantanzas.

OCCURRENCE:
McCone explained the situation which has resulted in a group led by Senor Bosch acquiring B-26's which are now in Costa Rica prepared to conduct a bombing raid on Cuba. The group discussed a draft State Department cable to various Latin American embassies related to this incident. It was agreed that the point should be made in the cable that any such contemplated raid would be premature at this time. Disassociation of the United States from any such endeavor was to be accomplished by leaking stories of the impending raid to the press.
