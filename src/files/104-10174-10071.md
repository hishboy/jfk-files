OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES

630 FIFTH AVENUE

NEW YORK, N. Y.

November 14, 1942

Mr. Hill Donovan

Luce Can-909

Office of Strategic Services

Washington, D. C.

Dear Colonel:

You may have heard already about Mrs. Luce's impression

of political matters in respect of the British Empire, but it is so

interesting and so relevant to our passing chance

on boring you with a repetition.

When Mrs. Luce went to

the Far East, she had an interview with Auchinleck, among others, and obtained from

him some extremely important and previously confidential information.

According to one account, she even recorded the date on which the

British offensive in North Africa was due to begin. She wrote this

information down in her notebook and inserted her criticism

of Auchinleck and of the British administration in that part of the

world and elsewhere, all of this in extremely uncomplimentary terms.

Previous to her return to America, she persuaded

Moncton to put her notes under some kind of an official British seal

with the idea that this would clear them without inspection at through

any British posts she might be passing on her way home. In addition

to these notes under seal, Mrs. Luce also had further notes in her

possession which she wrote after the earlier material was sealed.

When she arrived at the British censorship in Trinidad, a British

official looked through her unsealed papers and found on them the

notes in which she had expressed herself with considerable feeling about

the British. The official was moved however to break

the seal which Moncton had placed on the earlier material, and seeing

that too. Mrs. Luce felt very strongly about this action, and pro-

tested with great feeling, but the official at Trinidad was not

deterred.

So review was taken in Trinidad of Mrs. Luce's

notes, and most particularly of the information she had obtained

from Auchinleck, that the papers were sent to London. According

to one version, they even went to Mr. Churchill himself. They were

then sent to Washington-currently to the White House. It was only

after these several examinations that the papers were returned to Mrs. Luce.

This story is supposed to explain the disciplinary

action taken against both Moncton and Auchinleck some time ago, and

it's firmly believed, in at least some quarters, that Mrs. Luce's ex-

perience was not altogether unconnected with the "Open Letter" to the

British people recently published in Life Magazine.

---

Shortly after Mrs. Luce's return to this country,

she spoke at a meeting of the Overseas Press Club

in Washington. Both travels took a very strongly anti-British

line. The timing of her inform, and the at-

titude of the audience, friendly to her, so there seems to be reason to sup-

pose she provoked into saying anything she did not really

mean. Among other things, she said at this meeting that the Suez

Canal should be turned over to the Egyptians.

"When do you think this should be done?" she was

asked.

"Immediately," she replied.

"Even if that means turning it over to the Axis?" she was

asked.

"Yes," she said.

Another correspondent present at this meeting

cannot guarantee this account of Mrs. Luce's

remarks, but the account comes from extremely

well informed and sober minded persons who are without prejudice.

Hope to see you again soon.

All the best.

Yours,

Wallie Bennett
