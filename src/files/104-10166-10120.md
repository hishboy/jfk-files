MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG
SUBJECT:
James C. Wray,
OGC 68-0374
5 March 1968
1. I called Mr. James C. Wray today to determine his reason
for having called the Agency on 27 February regarding Antonio CUESTA
Del Valle's patent application. At that time Wray had stated that as a
patent attorney he was representing CUESTA who had an application
pending on which some $140 in fees was due.
:
2. Wray advised that he had been retained by CUESTA several
years ago to file an application concerned with a high speed boat on
which a patent was ready to issue upon payment of $140 in filing fees.
He stated further that as a consequence of CUESTA's subsequent capture
he had been unable to communicate with him and that he had failed in his
efforts to interest CUESTA's friends in assuming responsibility for the
fees. Wray readily accepted my representations that the Agency had no
· responsibility in the matter. According to him, he had called us merely
as a matter of last resort.
3. I found Wray's description of the boat's configuration and
attributes to be interesting. While emphasizing that we had no re-
sponsibility for his client's present situation or for his fees, I suggested
that he might want to provide me with the boat's specifications. Wray
accepted this suggestion. My thought here was that an item of this nature
might be of interest to SOD/Maritime Branch.

ACTA CE
:

1.
On 8 and 13 June 1967 the local LNERGO officer
who is handling the IDENTITY case informed a JMWAVE
officer that she had been recruited by the CUIS on her
recent visit to Cuba. LNERGO requests that the know-
ledge of this information be kept to a minimum, for they
LNERGO doos
intend to operate her as a double agent.
not intend to disseminate any information on the case,
at this time; however, the following information was
provided so that JIWAVE could furnish LNERGO with traces
and comments; .
.
•
A. IDENTITY received permission from U.S. and
Cuban authorities to travel to Cuba to visit her in-
prisoned husband. She arrived in Cuba on 7 April 1967
and (fau) INFANTE of the MININT mot hor at the airport.
In general, INFANTE was her escort; however, she also
had to keep Tita. (lnu) at #telephone number 30-2056
informed of her movements. *Enrique ECHEVARRIA wis
also assigned to IDENTITY's case and she thought'
possibly that he was INFANTE's superior officor.
described ECHEVARRIA as a DSE officer who had formerly
been in the 3.8. and who had some type of a back ailment..
