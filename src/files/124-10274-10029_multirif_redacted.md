Reference is made to Item V of the August 5, 1975,
request by the SSC for access to screen FBI materials.

Materials considered responsive to the SSC request
have been assembled and are available for review by SSC
Staff Members in Room 4171, JEH Building, regarding the
following parts of Item V:

Part A. Materials pertaining to Mrs. Claire (Anna)
Chennault and Spiro T. Agnew. Regarding Item V., A., 6.,
information pertaining to actions taken by the White House
as a result of information contained in the summary letters
described in Item V., A., 4., is not contained in FBI files.
Regarding Item V., A., 7., the FBI has no record of any former
or current Special Agent (SA) named William Jackson who could
have performed the tasks enumerated in the SSC request.
However, at the time that SA Phil Claridge was assigned to
the Albuquerque Field Office, there was also assigned there
a Special Agent named Gordon Jackson, now retired. The last
known residence for SA Claridge, who retired June 29, 1973,
is 619 16th Street N.W., Albuquerque, New Mexico. The last
known residence for SA Jackson is 1537 Wellesley Drive N.E.,
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Part B. Materials pertaining to Yeoman Charles E.
Radford.

Part E. Materials relating to the National Security
Agency (NSA) "watch list." Regarding this request, it should
be noted that no central file or individual case regarding
the "watch list" has been maintained by the FBI. Accordingly,
a diligent search of logical files and inquiries of personnel
possibly knowledgeable of information pertinent to the SSC
request have been conducted. Materials secured by this effort
have been assembled in chronological order, in order to
facilitate Staff review.

Part F. Materials pertaining to authorization for
FBI contacts with, dissemination of FBI information to, receipt
of information from, and requests by the FBI for action by
the Special Services Staff of the Internal Revenue Service.

Part G. The "Handbook of Technical Equipment."
Pursuant to agreement between Mr. John T. Elliff of the SSC
and Mr. William Cregar of the FBI, the aforementioned
handbook, which deals entirely with technical information, is
available for review by Mr. Elliff to determine its relevance
to SSC interests. Should Mr. Elliff determine that the
handbook or specific portions thereof are relevant, and request
delivery of same, prior review by FBI Laboratory personnel,
to determine the necessity for security classification of
requested materials, will be required before delivery.

Part H. Materials pertaining to FBI activity with
respect to the National Environmental Teach-in (also known
as "Earth Day"), April 22, 1970.

Part I: Materials pertaining to the origin and
implication of any decision to gather intelligence on "Women's
Liberation" in the FBI Philadelphia Field Office from 1969
to the present.

Part J. Additional SAC letters and memoranda
identified on a list attached to the referenced request.

Part K. Performance ratings (form FD-185) of
several named current or former FBI employees. Regarding
this request, pursuant to agreement between Mr. Elliff, supra
and Mr. Cregar, supra, the personnel file of former SA George
Berley, containing forms FD-185 regarding Mr. Berley, will be
available in the possession of a representative of the FBI
for discussion and responses to specific questions Mr. Elliff
may desire to ask regarding the performance ratings contained
therein.

Part L. The current office assignment or last known
address of individuals listed in Part K. of the request.

As previously indicated, the aforementioned materials
will be available in Room 4171, JEH Building.

Part C. of the referenced request concerned surreptitious
entries carried out by the FBI from January 1, 1960, to the
present. Part D. of the referenced request concerned materials
pertaining to any jurisdictional agreements, agreements of
coordination, or other agreements between the FBI and any other
Federal, state or local agency with regard to the conduct of
and dissemination of information from surreptitious entries.

The Department of Justice has previously informed the SSC that
it has the matter of surreptitious entries under study and the
FBI has been instructed by the Department of Justice to withhold
responses to inquiries concerning surreptitious entries until
Departmental study of the matter has been completed.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI
INSPECTOR DONALD E. MOORE
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

This memorandum and its enclosure contain
information concerning an interview on July 28, 1975, of
former FBI Inspector Donald E. Moore by Mr. Loch Johnson,
SSC Staff Member. Mr. Moore entered on duty with the FBI
on March 10, 1941, and served continuously in a variety of
assignments until his retirement on June 29, 1973.

On advance notice from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Moore was
advised that Mr. Johnson desired to interview him at Mr. Moore's
convenience relative to his knowledge of the Huston Report.

Mr. Moore was advised that he was being released from any
applicable employment agreement for purposes of the SSC
interview concerning the Huston Report. It was explained
to him that he had the right to counsel; however, the FBI
would be unable to provide private counsel. He was also advised
that there were certain privileged areas concerning which he
would not be required to answer questions. These areas
concerned information which might divulge the identities of
FBI sources; information relating to sensitive methods and
techniques; information which might adversely affect ongoing
FBI investigations; and information originating with other
agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Moore
was advised that if he desired an FBI representative to be
available for consultation at the time and place of the
interview, one would be supplied. Mr. Moore commented that

Interview of Donald E. Moore by
Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee
July 28, 1975

Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal
interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my
background which was provided him and included the fact that I
served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at
the end of June 1973.

The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee
and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee
was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill
Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before
the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson
was informed as follows:

I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by
Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett.
I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the
meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was
held June 5, 1970.) I was not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's
office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably
from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic
Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,
George Moore, Fred Cassidy and I were present. I did attend the
initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was
present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan
and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI
representatives were present. He mentioned George Moore and
Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.

I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from CIA were present
but did not recall the names of others including the representatives
from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired
the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.
Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't
stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although
he did not sit directly at the conference table.

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that
Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of
getting better intelligence information on new left activities and
violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to
possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas
of concern and asked representatives present to document where they
felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should
obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this
date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed
the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and
ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific
recommendations at a subsequent meeting. I am certain Mr. Huston
spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments.

This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.
I told Mr. Sullivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend
subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives
present and that the thrust was on new left and related activities. As
I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I
told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat
uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was
aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I
could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but
I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill
Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.

I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under
Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach
had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director
and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I
don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the
recommendations were added. I can't say whether I saw the report
prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing
the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether
Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume
Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this
basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson
was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt
he would have objected to the initial recommendations.

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report
had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated
the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware
Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell
expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was
withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this
occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.

Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or
after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage
was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-
ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,
Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my
pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the
Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department
of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this
aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what
was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies to obtain cryptographic materials.

Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had
been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover
to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I
answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not
make a definite statement yes or no.

He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to
the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I
did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the
Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and
met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better
arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.

He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,
Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to
NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was
aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.
I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for
support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally
and perhaps had written him.

RE:
THERE FOLLOWS A PRELIMINARY SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
PROVIDED BY SPECIAL AGENT (SA) JAMES P. KEHOE TO STAFF
MEMBERS OF SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON AUGUST 12, 1975. COMPLETE
DETAILS WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU WHEN THEY ARE RECEIVED
FROM SA KEHOE'S ATTORNEY.
THREE SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED BY SA KEHOE AND THEY WERE
SAM SURVEY, SUN SURVEY, AND Z COVERAGE. WITH REGARD TO SAM SURVEY,
IT WAS STATED THAT TO THE BEST OF HIS RECOLLECTION THIS BEGAN
ABOUT 1959 AND WAS BELIEVED TERMINATED IN 1963. IT BEGAN AS A
SURVEY TO OBSERVE THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPS DESTINED TO VARIOUS
CITIES IN EUROPE, LOOKING FOR INDICATORS WHICH WOULD LEAD TO
LOCATION OF SOVIET ILLEGAL AGENTS. AT A LATER POINT IN TIME
COVERAGE WAS ALSO MAINTAINED ON CERTAIN ADDRESSES IN EUROPE
KNOWN TO BE MAIL DROPS UTILIZED BY THE SOVIET INTELLIGENCE
SERVICE (SIS). THE ACTUAL SCRUTINY OF THE MAIL WAS CONDUCTED AT

PAGE TWO NY 105-146601 TO P
KENNEDY AIRPORT IN A ROOM AT THE POSTAL AIR MAIL FACILITY.
CERTAIN CONSTANT CITIES WERE EXAMINED AND OTHER CITIES WERE
SELECTED ON A VARIABLE BASIS. WHEN LETTERS WERE OBSERVED THAT
WERE BELIEVED TO MEET THE CRITERIA THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK TO THE
NEW YORK OFFICE (NYO) WHERE THEY WERE OPENED AND PHOTOGRAPHED
BY THE AGENT CONDUCTING THE Z COVERAGE. THE VOLUME WAS VERY
SMALL, PROBABLY CONSISTING OF ABOUT TEN LETTERS IN A SIX MONTH
PERIOD. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINE UTILIZED IN THE OPENING WAS
PROVIDED AND IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT WHEN A LETTER, BELIEVED
TO HAVE BEEN SENT BY A SOVIET AGENT WAS OBSERVED PHOTO COPIES
WERE PROVIDED TO HEAD QUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS, AN
INVESTIGATIVE FILE BEING OPENED IN NEW YORK CITY (NYC). THE SIZE
OF THE SQUAD HANDLING THIS TOTAL OPERATION WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
ABOUT TWENTY MEN. IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE POSTAL EMPLOYEES
WHOSE NAMES WERE NOT RECALLED MERELY PROVIDED THE MAIL POUCHES
AND WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE ROOM DURING THE SCREENING PROCESS.
IT WAS ALSO STATED THAT ANY MAIL REMOVED AND BROUGHT TO THE NYO
WAS RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT FOR DISPATCH ON THE NEXT OUTGOING
FLIGHT, TO THE CITY OF DESTINATION.

PAGE THREE NY 105-144061 TO P CRET
WITH REGARD TO SUN SURVEY IT WAS STATED THAT THIS OPERATION
WAS RUN BY THE SAME SQUAD BUT THAT IN THIS OPERATION THE ONLY
MAIL SCREENED WAS MAIL ADDRESSED TO THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) AT
A POST OFFICE BOX IN GRAND CENTRAL STATION. THE SCREENING TOOK
PLACE IN A ROOM PROVIDED BY THE POST OFFICE AT GRAND CENTRAL
STATION AND THE PURPOSE WAS TO OBTAIN MAIL WHICH MIGHT BE.
ADDRESSED TO SOVIET MEMBERS OF THE UN AT THIS BOX NUMBER. THESE
LETTERS WERE ALSO RETURNED TO THE NYO AND OPENED AND PHOTOGRAPHED
IN A SIMILAR MANNER. IN THIS INSTANCE, PHOTOGRAPHS WERE NOT
FORWARDED TO HEADQUARTERS BUT WERE FORWARDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL
CASE FILE OF THE SOVIET NATIONAL AND THE RESULTS OF THE MAIL
INTERCEPT WOULD BE REPORTED TO THE BUREAU AT THE NEXT REPORTING
SCHEDULE FOR THAT PARTICULAR CASE. IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT SUCH
COVERAGE RESULTED IN THE OPENING OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX LETTERS
A DAY.

WITH REGARD TO Z COVERAGE IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT SA KEHOE
HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS OPERATION BUT HAD BEEN PRESENT
IN THE ROOM, IN THE NYO, WHEN MAIL WAS OPENED. NO ESTIMATE COULD
BE GIVEN OF THE INCLUSIVE DATES OF COVERAGE OR THE VOLUME OF MAIL.

PAGE FOUR NY 105-144061 TO P CRET
BUT IT WAS STATED THAT ALL MAIL TO THE SOVIET MISSION TO THE
UN (SMUN) WAS OPENED AND PHOTOGRAPHED IN THE NYO AND THAT THIS
MAIL WAS PROVIDED BY POSTAL OFFICIALS AND THAT AFTER PHOTOGRAPHING
THE INFORMATION WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE INVESTIGATIVE CASE
FILES.

THE NAMES OF SOME INDIVIDUALS EMPLOYED IN THESE THREE
OPERATIONS WERE PROVIDED AND THE THOUGHT EXPRESSED THAT ALL
THREE OPERATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT
THE DECISION TO CONCLUDE THE OPERATIONS CAME FROM WASHINGTON.

IT WAS STATED THAT SA KEHOE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHICH
OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON APPROVED THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMS OR
TERMINATED THEM, BUT IT WAS FELT THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD
GIVE APPROVAL TO COMMENCE AND TERMINATE WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE
BEEN FORMER DIRECTOR HOOVER. OTHER QUESTIONS, SUCH AS DID THE
AGENT KNOW SPECIFIC NAMES, WERE ANSWERED EITHER AFFIRMATIVELY OR
NEGATIVELY, DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE NAMES RECOG-
NIZED WERE POSTAL INSPECTORS, AND QUESTIONS SUCH AS WAS THERE
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) AND
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) IN THESE OPERATIONS

PAGE FIVE NY L05-L4400 TO P CRET
WERE ANSWERED NEGATIVELY. QUESTIONS AS TO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIA'S
MAIL SCREENING OPERATION WERE ANSWERED IN EFFECT THAT SA KEHOE
GENERALLY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THESE OPERATIONS OTHER THAN WHAT
HE READ IN THE PAPERS.

A DIRECT QUESTION WAS ASKED IF SA KEHOE WAS AWARE THAT A
PIECE OF CORRESPONDENCE HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE MEDIA BREAK-IN
INDICATING THAT MAIL OPENINGS WENT ON AS LATE AS L970.. THE
ANSWER WAS GIVEN THAT HE HAD READ THIS STATEMENT IN THE PAPERS,
AND IT WAS THEN ASKED HOW HE WOULD EXPLAIN THIS. HE REPLIED THAT
HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WHATSOEVER., BUT THAT IF THE BUREAU
ISSUED A STATMENT ADVISING THAT ALL MAIL OPENINGS CEASED IN L966,
THEN THERE WAS AN EXPLANATION, BUT SA KEHOE WAS UNAWARE OF IT.

A QUESTION AS TO WHAT SPECIFIC INDICATORS WERE LOOKED FOR
IN SAM SURVEY WAS NOT ANSWERED ON THE GROUNDS THAT SUCH INFORMATION
REPRESENTED A SENSITIVE TECHNIQUE THAT WAS STILL VIABLE.

AT NO POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS DID SA KEHOE EXCERCISE HIS
RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE UNDER TE FIFTH AMENDMENT.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams
FROM : Legal Counsel
SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Mr. Callahan requested that a research be conducted to
determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be
authorized to pay for private counsel for employees called to testify
before the Senate Select Committee and who desired private counsel.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the
Department is that we could not provide counsel directly to the individuals
because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the
individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my
knowledge the question concerning whether the Government could pay for
private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched.

Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer
and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahan' request.

FROM : Legal Counsel
SUBJECT: AUTHORITY OF FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF

Legal Counsel memorandum to you dated 7-8-75
captioned Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities," recommended that the Administrative Division
and Legal Counsel Division confer and prepare an appropriate
response to Mr. Callahan's request that research be con-
ducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of
Justice would be authorized to pay for private counsel for
employees who are called to testify before the Senate
Select Committee and who desire private counsel. We have
also undertaken to present the statutory considerations
governing the provision of such representation in a legal
proceeding as distinguished from a legislative hearing.

Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, states:

"Except as otherwise authorized
by law, the head of an Executive
department or military department
may not employ an attorney or
counsel for the conduct of litiga-
tion in which the United States,
an agency, or an employee thereof
is a party, or is interested, or
for the securing of evidence there-
for, but shall refer the matter to
the Department of Justice.

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that
only the Attorney General has the authority to make a
contract for special employment of an attorney. This
Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, ob-
viously does not have authority to do that which is
denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of
coequal stature to the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

An examination of our budgetary language by
representatives of the Administrative Division and this
Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit
authority which would qualify as "otherwise authorized by
law, . . ." under the above statute. The statutory
authority for provision of private counsel is contained in
Title28, United States Code, Section 515, which gives the
Attorney General the authority to appoint and pay special
attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the
statement that these attorneys "may, when specifically
directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal
proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury pro-
ceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates,
which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to
conduct. . . ." It is evident then that this authority
pertains only to proceedings held within the judicial
system, not to hearings held before a legislative body.
Such a hearing is not a "legal proceeding" and is not
one "which United States Attorneys are authorized by
law to conduct. . . ."

In the event that employees need representation
in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a
potential conflict of interest would prevent it from
providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed and
paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed.
Whether the Department would allow the individual employee
to designate or select the outside counsel would be a
matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why
such an individual selection would not ordinarily be
approved.

We are aware that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnold
and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm
has been designated as the individual attorney to represent
that agency. Inquiry with CIA has determined that the
authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United
States Code, Section 403j, which states:

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

"(a) Notwithstanding any other
other provisions of law, sums
made available to the Agency
by appropriation or otherwise
may be expended for purposes
necessary to carry out its
functions, including -

"(1) personal services, including
personal services without regard
to limitations on types of
persons to be employed. . . ."

We would emphasize, however, that the counsel
hired represents the CIA, not individual employees, and
that private counsel has the same problems as does their
"in-house" counsel. Therefore, no firm or individual
hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual
employee in any situation which presents a potential
conflict between the interests of the individual and the
interests of the agency.

CONCLUSION:

We conclude that there is no authority for either
the FBI or the Department to pay for private counsel
selected by employees called to testify before the Senate
Select Committee or any other legislative body. If an
employee called to testify in such a forum desires private
counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes
representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department
impossible, the employee must decide if the possible
consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel
and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him.

Furthermore, private counsel retained by an
agency having authority to do so would be under the
same disabilities as "in-house" or Departmental counsel
in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

The only authority for payment by the Department of
private counsel would be in a legal proceeding in the
judicial system under Title 28, United States Code,
Section 515.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information.
