MEWORAMDUY FOR: Deputy Chief, WHD for Cuba .
SUBJECT: | “Status of AMCIVIC = AMBIDDY-2 | an

=
1. The status of the ANCIVIC activity has reached

the point vheve 1¢ must either be made into a useful ongoing .
activity or die gor lack of purpose aad justification. t

-2. As it now stands the activity's Principal Agent,
AMBIDOY-1, is both literally and figuratively ‘flaying about"
im @ series of half-projects and half-plane which are —
ao: Q@either meaningful to the Agency, seaningful to A-l wr
- . meaningful to. bis political movement. If he ie to be taken
at his word he is currently deeply involved both financially
“and politically with Genvral Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua.
Financially he has committed sons 375,000 of his Movenent’s
' money in a shipbuilding scheme supposedly to be established |
at Monkey Point, Nicaragua. The plan, as envisioned by A-l,
would be, that upon completion of these shipyards, they would \
e@ffer enployment and educational opportunities for the H
ignorant and poverty stricken Indians of the area. Once co, i
im cperation, A-1 expscts that the profits froea this. ’ |
1

nn

@peration will be :iowed back isto’ other endeavors such
ag a fishing cooperative and a farming coopers tive-—-also

. te ultinately benefit the area's indigenous population.’
All of this, of courze, hingea upon two fundasental factors:
Firetly, it depends upon the continued gocdwill of General |

» tegether with his williegness to contribute monies

to the previously mentioned scheme. Secondly, it depends to
@ lesser extent upon A~-l's ability te forge ahead with the

er rs

«. program. This ia turs hinges upoa A-1'’s financial status
and abilities. ; -

a 3. a to the first Zzactor, General Sesoma has never het - moo
@ reputation for benign wagoaninity. The facts show quite Oo .
the opposite. He has a reputation for being a hard-headed
self-c5eeking busineosmisnxilitariat who now aspires to political
office. Anyone wks cau help obviously recoives his support..

ft Therefore, should A-1's project moet with success, Somcea
bho would benefit both financially and politically. It is
\ . : @ifficult to imagine A-1 deriving the sane acvantages

: especially vhen added to these considerations, is the fact
that they have nothing vhatever to do with Cuba or Cubans.

. . 4. As. to the second factor, and returning to the sore
“ft : realistic aspects of the problem, A-] ia the past has denoa-
W strated bis ability to sell ideas and projects. In & word
be ie a politician. Kowever, when it cones to adninistrative,
business and financial matters he is singularly inopt. This
. was amply demonstrated during the AMIORLD era when it was
. : only thanss to the efforts of other veli-qudlified people
: . that the project was ever able to sustain itself. In
s' , as it now stands A~l is in the position of being
: . wholly beholdva of the good offices of General Sonoma. .
f Be further derives no political advantages from this and
! fs engaged in projects for which he has no basic qualifications.
Ya a sense he ie leading with his weakest card. Hore
seriously, his efforts are politically out of focus.

: 8. The above presents an admittedly gloomy picture of

, Ael and his current activities, however, there are certain .

in aspects of the situation vhich might be used in order to.

« igechannel A-1's efforts. For one, A-l claims that bis =

; magazine Tridente is now running in the black (this, of course,

ain comes from A-l eho probably has difficulty distinguishing an

: i . aseet froma liability). Secezdly, be haa purchased 22 acres

. ~ ef land in West Palm Beach wheve bo is supposedly to start — :

. training Nicaraguan Indians in the complexities of cooperative
farming. Both cf these endeavors represent the positive and
realistic side of A-l's progras. They also represent, or —
eould represent, his Cuban efforts instead of his Nicaraguas
etfarts. Instead of Nicaraguan Indians, 4-1 should be:
concentrating on training Cuban exile. tie proceeds

bv’

be refecusics bis pelitios) efforta while at the enue. tine
' daproving bis Cubaa image. Fron ths Agercy'’s point of vicc
it could also be sore easily supervised. : .

6. It 4s therefore requested that the undersigned be
_ sllowed to sit down with A-l and point out the folly of his ;
eurrent activities and atteapt to refocus them along the lines
mentioned above. Should he accept these suggestions further
efforts would then be made to encourage A~] to hire a :

coupetent businesoman to supervise his financial affairs.
Vorther, once located (preferably by us) future support
payaents would be aade to the business manager instend of
te A-l, with stricter accounting and double-chec«cing
fravolved. It would also bo suggested that less security
would be observed and more direct looxing into A~l business
would be the order of the day. Ag auch, it is also |
Fecommended that the undorsigned be allowed to actually
visit the farm and report bacx on the actual status of the
fara. A-1 would also be told that henceforth, except oa

¥I collection missions, he should confine his efforts te
the farm and developing a sensible programs for cooperative
training of Cubans, not Micaraguans, or any other nationals.

7%. ‘(Ys summary A-1 should be told that unless he is . aan
prepared to refocus his activities more realistically the .
Ageacy's gravy train is about to pull into the station.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with ANBIDDY-1 De (

1. AMBIDDY-1 telephoned the undersigned and indicated
that he was forced to postpone his projected interview with
President Raul Leoni of Venezuela due to the latter's having
&@ tight schedule, As it now stands, A-1 plans to travel to
Venezuela within ten days for the projected meeting.

“9. A+l stated that he was in contact with Costa Rican
Presidential candidate, Daniel Oduber, during his last visit...

. QOduber supposedly asked for A-i's assistance in trying to .

overcome a recent spate of rumors surrounding his (Oduber's) |
allegiance with Communists. (Note: A-l is already printing
gome of Oduber’s campaign material, so presumably this. request
falls within the context of the general propaganda discussions
which A-1 and Oduber held). . .

,

3. Al was asked if he had picked up any further “angorma-
. tien on the "mysterious Italian" which he reported on during

his previous Costa Rica visit. He said that he had not but
that his local representative in San Jose had been given.

* .Gmstructions to try in every way possible to develop further .

d4nformation on the man. As an aside, A-1 stated that he had

- discussed the matter with the Chief of the Costa Rican
>." Security Service. More specifically, A-l asked that if by
-. ehance his own men located the individual, whether the Costa. .

Rican Service would mind if he "transported" ths man across |
the border to Nicaragua where they would be better able to

deal with him. He claimed that the chief offered no objections -

. #6 this plan, The undersigned cautioned A-1l is any interna-
tional "transporting" schenes. : oe -

4. From Costa Rics, A-1 traveled to Nicaragua where he

held a meeting with Anastasio Somoza, The discussion centered

on A-l's scheme for setting up a shipbuilding and dry dock

facility near Monkey Point.. In the course of this discussion,

A-l claims to have obtained an offer from the GON for the -

” that the passport was

-2-

financing of the shipyard in the awount of $125,000, A-1

claims that this amount, coupled with his own contribution

: @f $75,000, should be enough to begin construction of the

facility’as well as a school for teaching the indigenous
people of ‘the area how to read and write in addition to
acquiring a skill in shipbuilding and repairing. .

. 5. As for politics, A-] stated that Somuza was definitely
not interested. in embroiling himself with the Guatemalan and
Costa Rican coup planners such as Roberto Alejos Arzu and
Miguel Ruiz Herrera, The main reason for this was his concern
with his own campaign in Nicaragua, Soacza, however, adaittod
to A-l that he had given some money to Guatemalan Col. Ponciano
dn order that the latter would be able to’ start his electoral
campaign in Guatemala. A-1 emphasized that the money was ine
tended to support a legal campaign within the gramework of Oo
the current constitutional and electoral laws and not for
support of the extra-legal efforts of Alejos and company.

6. . As an item of incidental interest, A-1, while in

” costa Rica, met with Roberto Madrid, the current Secretary to” ” ©

the Costa Rican President (possibly Secretary to the future _
President). Madrid in the. past had been most helpful to :
AMBIDDY-1's movement in Costa Rica. By coincidence, Madrid .
was on his way to Miami for a one-week vacation so that A-1 _
invited him to stay at his. house.and.attend his daughter's
baptism, Madrid and his wife, therefore, are current AMBIDDY-1

‘house guests. tase. :

'@,. Finally, the undersigned queried AMBIDDY-1 on whether
he had been successful in obtaining a Nicaraguan passports
for AMJAVA-4 in order that the latter might proceed with his

- plans for enrolling in the University of Mexico, A-1 replied
issued by the GON and would be mailed

direct to A-<4 within the next week or two. -

___ Catef, Vestern ‘Hemisphere Division

1, . Tranemitted herewith are tape recordings of talks
which have been taped by AMBIDDY-1 at the request of Head-
quarters for possible re-broadcast into Cuba. 4s, originally.
conceived, it was thought that AMBIDDY-1 would firstly set

forth in broad terms reasons for his talks and then proceed .-
through a series of short epeeches to address various political
and. economic groups within Cuba - such i:3 the "becados" and

the Military elements. In each case the overall theme would

be to appeal to the basic patriotic emotions of the various -
e@ocial groups and then contrast this patriotism with the

current regime which has not onl) butrayed the ideals of genuine
social justice but has betrayed the nation itself.

3. It is therefore requested that the Station review
the attachments, which have been submitted on a pilot basis, .
and that any suggestions and/or comments regarding their usage
. be forwarded to Headquarters for. further consideration. Plesse
also include views on what Radio Station would be most appro=
priate for the broadcasts,
