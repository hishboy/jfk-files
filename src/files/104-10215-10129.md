MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/OA
FROM: Deputy Director of Security (Investigations and Support)
SUBJECT: C-25507
#112569

1. Reference is made to a memorandum dated 17 April 1958 from
WH Division through CI/OA requesting that the Covert Security Approval
granted on 3 July 1957 be amended to permit Subject's utilization as
a career agent in Mexico City under Project LLEDGE.

This will confirm the verbal Covert Security Approval granted
to Mr. Larry Sulc, WH Division on 3 June 1958 for the use described
above.

2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Clandestine Services Instruction
Field No. 10-5, a covert security approval is granted for the use of
the Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph 1,
above.

3. Subjects of covert security approvals are not to represent
themselves as; nor are they to be represented as, employees of CIA.

4. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
approval does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should desire at a later
date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for
approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this
office.

5. This approval becomes invalid in the event the Subject
services are not utilized within six months of the date of this
memorandum.

14 May 1958

1. Miss Emily Brockebran, FI/Projects, telephoned the visiter to report that FI intends to hold up final processing of the subject project until a determination is reached by the Office of Security concerning the request for a Covert Security Approval on the agent's assignment in Mexico City.

2. The visitor agreed to advise FI/Projects when CI/OA receives a report from the Office of Security.

FI/Projects advised per above 23 May 1958.

Amendment: [X] Extension for: [ ] months; termination: [ ]
Project approval period from: 1 May 1958 to: 30 April 1959

Recommendations:
1. CI/OA recommends approval on condition the agent Harold R. NORMAYR receives, from the office of Security, a Covert Security Approval for his new assignment in Mexico City and the results of his LCFLUTTER are satisfactorily resolved. Also, on condition that should the Office of Security request a clearance and LCFLUMMER on this agent's wife, a clearance is issued and LCFLUTTER results are satisfactorily resolved.

2. A new request for CSA for Subject's use in Mexico City was submitted to the office of Security on 24 April 1958. When the office of Security issued Subject's last CSA on 3 July 1957, they recommended that subject be afforded a polygraph as soon as possible. Subject was given an LCFLUTTER a few days ago and although subject ran clean the polygraph operator began getting same reaction, or hits, regarding the Subject's wife. There is some derogatory information in the Office of Security on what is believed to be the subject's wife and sister-in-law.

3. The Office of Security has not reached a final decision regarding CSA and LCFLUMMER for Subject's wife. They have stated, however, that unless the wife can be cleared and LCFLUTTER results are clean, it is doubtful whether a new clearance would be issued for the career agent.

1. Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February
1957 wherein a covert security approval was requested to enable
the Subject's conversion from contract agent to career agent
status for use as principal agent for Project AMPHODARCH in
Cuba under non-official cover. Reference is also made to our
memorandum of 2 April 1957 in which a provisional covert
security clearance was granted for the above use.

2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Director's Memorandum of 14 February 1949 entitled, "Security
and Operational Clearances," a covert security clearance is
granted for the use of the Subject, as described in your request
as set forth in paragraph 1, above.

3. This clearance is contingent upon the following:
a. The receipt by this office of full overseas
traces and such actual overseas investigation as is
possible on Subject and on his wife and her family.
b. that Subject be afforded a polygraph inter-
rogation as soon as possible and that the verbatim
results be promptly furnished to this office. The
Office of Security will be happy to assist in
arranging this interrogation.

4. Subjects of covert security clearances are not to represent
themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of
CIA.

5. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the
provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date to change the status or use of this
individual, a request for clearance to cover any proposed change
should be submitted to this office.

Crozier, Ross Lester

1. Concurrent with this memorandum a covert security
clearance is being issued to enable the Subject's conversion from
contract agent to career agent for use as principal agent for
Project AMPHODARCH in Cuba under non-official cover.

2. This is to advise that information has been received
from a confidential source of the Office of Security concerning
Argentina CORDERO Calderon and her sister, Counsuelo, who are
believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-law respectively.

According to a December 1944 report, the above individuals were
described as Costa Rican citizens then in Panama under
suspicion and members of the Russian Ballet team of Pedro and
Lidia CHUPRINE. Argentina is known to speak and understand
German. She was formerly married to Pedro MARZAL, reportedly
a German national and formerly on both British and U. S.
Proclaimed List. She is reliably reported to have made pro-
German remarks and is pro-German in her sympathies. It was
further reported that both of the above individuals have at
times attempted to secure information from members of the
American Armed Forces.

3. In view of the above information, it is requested that
current overseas traces and investigation be conducted on the
Subject as well as on his wife and sister-in-law, Counsuelo,
and other members of his wife's immediate family and that the
results thereof be furnished this office.

4. The covert security clearance which is being issued
in this case is made contingent upon the favorable results of
the requested overseas traces and investigation.

MEMORANDUM
TO: Chief, CI/CA
FROM: Acting Deputy Director of Security (Investigations and Support)
SUBJECT: C-25507
#112569

1. Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February 1957,
wherein a provisional covert security approval and a covert security
approval were requested to enable the Subject's conversion to career
agent status for use as Principal Agent for Project AMPHODARCH in
Cuba, under non-official cover.

2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Field Regulation 10-215, a pro-
visional covert security approval is granted for the use of the
Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph #1,
above.

3. It should be noted that the provisional covert security
approval herein granted is based on limited investigative coverage
and should not be in any way construed as a final security deter-
mination relative to a full covert security approval. Upon com-
pletion of additional investigation now pending, you will be ap-
propriately advised as to our decision with regard to the issuance
of a full covert security approval.

4. Subjects of provisional covert security approvals are not
to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as,
employees of CIA.

5. Your attention is called to the fact that a provisional
covert security approval does not constitute complete compliance
with the provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date
