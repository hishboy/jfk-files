MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Support
SUBJECT: Request for Exception to Provision of FR 45-10b - Terence S. CRABANAC (P)

1. This memorandum contains a recommendation in paragraph 4 for the approval of the Deputy Director for Support.

2. Terence S. CRABANAC (P) is a Contract Employee assigned to the Madrid area in Spain in a sensitive assignment since his conversion from a Staff Employee on 4 July 1965. CRABANAC was a GS-15, step 7 ($19,880.00 per annum) and is being paid at the same rate in his present contract status. His contract provides that he will be entitled to a living quarters allowance in conformance with regulations of this organization applicable to its appointed personnel.

3. The basic living quarters allowance for Class II officers in Madrid is $2,900 per annum. The house which CRABANAC has located, with a one year lease from 15 November 1965 to 14 November 1966, has an annual rent of $6,600.00 excluding utilities. Therefore, for rent alone, he will be $1,960.00 per year over the 160 percent maximum allowed under the provisions of FR 45-10b. On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent over the quarters allowance, he would be out of pocket $2,395.00.

4. Due to the operational sensitivity of CRABANAC's assignment, his request for relief on his housing costs was handled by Mr. Thomas Karamessines, ADDP. On 15 September 1965, Mr. Karamessines, ADDP, approved his being reimbursed on a 75/25 percent basis for the excess allowable costs up to, but not to exceed, 60 percent above his quarters allowance. This authorization was included in a letter to CRABANAC from Mr. Karamessines. It is requested that the Deputy Director for Support authorize the 75/25 percent sharing of the excess allowable costs up to 60 percent above his quarters allowance.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Thomas H. Karamessines
SUBJECT: Madrid Housing

1. The following is a listing of the GS-13 and above staff employees and their quarters costs as of April 1965:

| Grade & No. of Dependents | Allowance | Cost | Cost to Individual |
|---|---|---|---|
| (COS)GS-16 (3) | $2,900 | $4,236 | All cost paid |
| GS-15 (1) | 2,900 | 3,132 | $116 |
| GS-15 (0) | 2,000 | 1,800 | 0 |
| GS-14 (5) | 2,900 | 2,796 | 0 |
| GS-14 (5) | 2,900 | 3,840 | 450 |
| GS-13 (3) | 2,000 | 2,280 | 140 |
| GS-13 (3) | 2,000 | 2,472 | 236 |
| GS-13 (5) | 2,000 | 2,544 | 272 |

2. Mr. Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900. Using the same formula as applied to the other staff employees at the Station, the following would be the figures:

$2,900 + 60% ($1,740) = $4,640

On a 50/50 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4,640.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he would be out-of-pocket $435, if his costs were $4,640.

3. I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 percent sharing basis of the allowable excess costs up to, but not to exceed, 60 percent above his quarters allowance.

REFERENCE: A. OGC Opinion 65-2476a, dated 12 August 1965
B. Our Memo, dated 8 July 1965, Same Subject

1. This office herein recommends an amendment to CRABANAC's Supplement dated 4 July 1965, to delete paragraph 7. entitled "Offset."

2. This office acknowledges the OGC opinion, Reference A, which determined CRABANAC may retain without Agency salary offset any future royalties earned as a result of his literary efforts based on the fact cover does not include role of a writer.

3. As Subject's cover "activities" have been officially clarified as being only a light one of a retired Foreign Service Officer for which the Agency will be making all entitlement payments and actually he will receive no funds from any cover, this paragraph, which is misleading, has no meaning in Subject's contract and it is hereby recommended that it be deleted from CRABANAC's Supplement.

4. Further, in future cases when a cover is so light that Subject will not be receiving funds from cover it is recommended that no "Offset" paragraph be included in Supplements or Contracts.

2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his "cover activities."

The objective of the cover is to provide a basis of attribution for some of his income. At the time of the preparation of Mr. Crabanac's contract, the specific detail of his cover was unknown.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Contract Personnel Division, O/P
SUBJECT: General - Terence S. CRABANAC - Supplement
Specific - Paragraph Entitled "OFFSET"

1. This office has a question as to the intent of including paragraph (7.) entitled "OFFSET" as appears in the Contract for Terence S. CRABANAC. The paragraph in question reads as follows:

"7. OFFSET
Emoluments (including benefits in kind) received from or through your cover activities are the property of the U.S. Government. Procedurally, such emoluments will be offset against amounts due you under this agreement and are acknowledged to be payment by the Government hereunder and for Federal income tax purposes. If cover emoluments exceed those due you under this contract, you will dispose of the excess amount in conformance with Governmental instructions."

2. Subject reportedly is proceeding abroad under the cover of a retired Foreign Service Officer and in pursuit of his ambitions as a writer. Subject will receive all his contractual benefits through the Agency, there is no cover company, so therefore the only apparent emoluments to be received from or through his cover activities would be earnings received from articles, stories, or books written by him. Please inform this office if its interpretation is correct. If not, we would appreciate your interpretation and reasoning relative to the statement "Emoluments received from or through your cover activities are the property of the U.S. Government."
