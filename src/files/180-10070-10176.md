Final Determination Notification

AGENCY: HSCA
RECORD NUMBER: 180-10070-10176
RECORD SERIES: STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER:

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 12

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

December 20, 1976

Richard Sprague
Select Committee on Assassinations
House Annex II
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

Gail Beagle suggested that I contact you concerning employment possibilities with the Select Committee. I am seeking a legal position on the Committee staff, and would like very much to speak with you concerning those possibilities.
I am a Harvard Law School graduate and a member of the bar.
Before going to law school, I was an intern with Congressman Gonzalez. In addition, I have graduate degrees and considerable experience (including teaching at Harvard) in modern American history, a facet which might be of interest to the Committee.

In Washington, a reference can be provided by former Speaker Carl Albert, who knows me well. He would be happy to respond to a request for information concerning my abilities.

I shall be in Washington through Friday, and hope to see you during that time if it is in any way possible.

Sincerely,

Paul Zevnik
