solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the US Government gave much equipment
and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets.
According to TEPEDENO (AMLASH) feels strongly on this point, and if he does not get
advice and materials from a U.S. Government technician, he will probably become fed up
