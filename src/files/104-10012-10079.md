Dear Charles,

Thank you for your letter of 15 October recommending against the declassification of Warren Commission document C3-971. I might mention that our inquiry to you in August (1968) was in anticipation of further pressure for the release of Warren Commission papers, a pressure which has not materialized. Accordingly, there is not, at the present time, any intention to release C3-971.

Should the question be raised some future time, the points made by you in your letter provide every reason to keep the document out of the public domain.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,
[s] Richard Helms
Richard Helms
Director
