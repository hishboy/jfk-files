A. NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER

Introduction

During his 11 or 12 years' service in the KGB Second Chief
Directorate, NOSENKO said, he rose from case officer to deputy
chief of a department and from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel
(or, as he has stated more recently, only to the rank of captain).
An English speaker, he had specialized in operations against
American targets in the USSR as he steadily advanced to higher
positions in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department
(from entry on duty with the KGB in 1952 or 1953 until 1955,
and from January 1960 to January 1962) and in the Tourist Depart-
ment (from June 1955 to January 1960, and from January 1962 until
the defection). His duties took him to England in 1957 and 1958,
Cuba in 1960, and Bulgaria in 1961 as well as to Switzerland in
1962 and 1964; also, NOSENKO made numerous trips within the USSR
in connection with operations, inspections, and conferences.
Commendations, twice accompanied by bonuses, were awarded to him
by the KGB Chairman in 1956, 1959, and 1961 and by the head of
the Second Chief Directorate in 1957 and 1958; he was one of
70 Second Chief Directorate officers awarded the Order of the
Red Star in 1962; and in the same year he received a medal for
completing ten years of "irreproachable service."* Thus,
according to NOSENKO, his defection ended a promising career
marked by promotions, responsible positions, extensive travel,
and many honors.

NOSENKO has discussed a large number of KGB operations, in-
cluding some in which he had a personal role, either as a par-
ticipant or as a supervisor, and others conducted by other KGB
personnel in the First and Second Chief Directorate about which
he learned through his professional and personal contacts.
Those in which he played a personal role are covered in this
part of the paper. All are included in Part VI. The text of
the paper distinguishes the information from collateral sources
and investigations from the details which NOSENKO has provided
on the same topics.

* NOSENKO has admitted recently, however, that he never got
any awards at all in the KGB.

B. Entry into the KGB

NOSENKO has provided a wide range of dates for his entry
on duty with the KGB and has offered disparate descriptions of
the circumstances and procedures involved in his becoming a
KGB staff officer. His statements on these two topics are
presented under separate headings below.

1. Date of Entry

A range of dates between early 1952 and 2 April 1953 has
been given by NOSENKO as the time when he entered on duty with
the KGB, but he has been most consistent in placing his entry
in the month of March 1953.* In summary, he has said the
beginning of 1952 (statement of 31 January 1964), May 1952 with
no day (statement of February 1964), 5 or 7 September 1952
(statement of 6 April 1964), March 1953 with no day (statements
of 9 June 1962, 24 April 1966 and 27 October 1966), 12 or 15 or
17 March 1953 (statement of 8 April 1964), 13 or 15 March 1953
(statement of 26 July 1965), and 2 April 1953 (statement of
17 April 1966). When last questioned about this subject, on
27 October 1966, NOSENKO acknowledged that he had lied when he
had earlier reported his entry as occurring in 1952. His state-
ments about the entry date are arranged in chronological order
below.

9 June 1962 (first CIA meeting with NOSENKO): "In the
beginning of 1953 I came to Moscow [from duty with the GRU in
Primorsk]. This was 1953, in the beginning, in January. Well,
I came on leave to Moscow. I was staying at my father's dacha
there... I was then in the Navy GRU. So I came to Moscow on
leave and, while I was home near Moscow at my father's dacha,
[General Bogdan Zakharovich] KOBULOV** dropped in on us. A con-
versation simply began. He said: 'What are you doing?' I said:
'I'm working in GRU. I worked in the Far East and now I'm work-
ing in the Baltic. I came here on leave.' KOBULOV said: 'How
do you like the work?: I replied: 'Well, speaking honestly, I
don't like the work.' 'Well,' he said, 'You better come to work
with us. Where do you want to go? Into intelligence or counter-
intelligence?'... I did not want to go into intelligence. I

* Several of NOSENKO's remarks about his date of entry into
the KGB were made during CIA questioning about how and
when he first learned of the KGB agent "ANDREY"; the lead
to "ANDREY" was one of the two pieces of information which
NOSENKO offered to sell when he approached CIA in 1962
(see Part II.B.); the "ANDREY" case is discussed at
greater length in Part VI.D.3.b.

** Other sources have reported that KOBULOV was expelled
from the State Security apparatus in 1946 and that he did
not return to a position of authority until a few days
after Lavrentiy BERIYA became MGB-MVD Minister on 9 or
10 March 1953. As of 1952, KOBULOV was working in East
Germany for both Wismut A.G., a uranium ore-mining con-
cern, and for the Soviet contingent to the Allied Control
Commission. KOBULOV was arrested at the same time as
BERIYA, along with others in the KGB. See Part V.B.2.
for further references to KOBULOV.

consider that only people who have seven, even ten years' ex-
perience in counterintelligence work should be sent to intelli-
gence. After this, let them go into positive intelligence.
Then they know how counterintelligence operates... Well, when
KOBULOV asked me where I wanted to work, I answered: 'It is
better, of course, to go into counterintelligence.' 'Well,' he
said, 'Good. Look, drop in to see me for a minute sometime.'
This was simple conversation. Nothing official. A week later
I got a telephone call. They were calling from Personnel and
told me to stop by. I went. 'Come into this room,' they told
me, 'it's not necessary to fill out a questionnaire (anketa).
We have already obtained your personal file from the GRU. Go
directly to the central entrance. A pass has already been
issued for you; the pass is already there. Go to the Secre-
tariat of Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV.' Well, I went. KOBULOV
had been summoned somewhere high up in the government, and his
assistant received me. 'How about working in the American De-
partment?' he [the assistant] asked. 'Well, good. Go there
right now.' Well, I went to the Second Directorate... His
KOBULOV's assistant sent me directly to the Second Directo-
rate, the American Department, the First Section, working with
American correspondents...in '53, in March, in March '53. STALIN
had just died."*

*STALIN died on 5 March 1953.

31 January 1964: Yuriy Ivanovich GUK was reassigned from
the KGB Second Chief Directorate "in something like 1952,"
NOSENKO said, "exactly just about the time when I came from
the GRU to the KGB. He was already gone by that time."*

February 1964: After his defection on 4 February 1964,
NOSENKO prepared an official statement about his biography.
He said that he had entered the KGB in 1952, and he shifted
the dates of most of the events during the 1945-1955 period one
year backwards from the version given in 1962. This was dis-
cussed with NOSENKO, and he repeated the new dates; he then
studied and approved an official statement on his biography
(for the Intelligence Community) which contained the new dates,
including his claim that he entered on duty with the KGB in
about May 1952.

6 April 1964: Confronted with the above inconsistencies,
NOSENKO said that he returned to Moscow in August 1952 and during
the same month had a conversation with KGB personnel about getting
a job. The interview continued with the following dialogue:

Question: You came (to Moscow) in January?

NOSENKO: No, it wasn't January, it was the second part of
1952. Yes, before that I was in the GRU...
Maybe - if I tell you 7 - 7 September - maybe
it was 5, I don't know.

Question: ...What date did you enter on duty with KGB?
NOSENKO: I don't remember.
Question: Early September 1952?

NOSENKO: Early September 1952, yes... I came and the
first few days was sitting in a room with
KUTYREV, RAKOVSKIY, and GROBOV, in Room 615.
Yes, it was 7 September when I had joined...
7 or 5... And so the first few weeks I had been
reading cases, studying forms; I worked like
that (during) December, January, February...
No, it was March, yes, after STALIN's death,
after the reorganization. And at the end of
March I was transferred to the attaches cases..

* This would place the entry date some time at the beginning
of 1952, for the KGB defector GOLITSYN has reported that
GUK was transferred from the Second Chief Directorate in
January 1952.

** NOSENKO later settled on June or July 1954 as the time of
this transfer. Part V.C. covers the period when, according
to NOSENKO, he was engaged in operations against the U.S.
military attaches in Moscow.

8 April 1964: The interrogator pointed out to NOSENKO that
he had on different occasions dated his entry into the KGB as
January 1952, March 1953, and in September 1952. The questioning
continued:

Question: Which is the truth?

NOSENKO: After the death of STALIN, in March 1953. Why
did I say it [the other dates]? You see, I
finished the Institute in 1949. Then I defended
my diploma, and then came the State exams. I
passed all the exams except one - "Foundations of
Marxism-Leninism" the philosophy. And I had to
take all the examinations over again. All of
them. I took four, passed three, flunked one.
Just the same, all four had to be taken over
again. For that reason I graduated, or I received
the diploma from the Institute in 1950, although
officially I graduated in 1949. This is an un-
pleasant thing and I did not want to mention it.
And right after that I was sent to the GRU.* The
rest is just as I told you, word-for-word. This
was the only thing. And then, after I said it,
I did not want to correct it. To twist around
again. And the mistake I made was about my work
in the KGB. It was not 1952, of course, but
1953... It was 12 or 17 or 15 March. KOBULOV
accepted me right away. STALIN was still not
dead and I was already accepted. March 1953,
about the 15th, about 15 March 1953.

26 July 1965: "At the end of 1952 I came to Moscow from
Sovetsk in Primorskiy Kray, near Baltiysk. I had worked in the
Naval Intelligence Point (MRP) there. My aim in coming to
Moscow was to get out of this work in the MRP. I couldn't
stand that work. I couldn't stand that work... I arrived in
Moscow at the end of 1952, December... I don't remember exactly
the date of the order appointing me an officer in the KGB. It
was 13 or 15 March 1953."

17 April 1966 (letter to CIA case officer): "From August
1952 until 1953 I worked at the Intelligence Point of the Naval
Intelligence of the 4th Fleet in Sovetsk, where I received the
rank of lieutenant of the Administrative Service. From 2 April
1953 until 4 February 1964 I worked in the Second Chief Direc-
torate of the MGB-KGB."

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement): "In
the middle of March /1953/ KOBULOV's assistant, Colonel
SAVITSKIY called me at home and told me to come to see KOBU-
LOV... I worked in the First Section, First /American/ Depart-
ment from the middle of March 1953 until July 1955."

27 October 1966: NOSENKO reaffirmed that he entered the
KGB in mid-March 1953. He said that he had lied when he earlier
said that he had joined the KGB in 1952, and that he knew he was
lying at the times he made these statements. Asked why he had
lied, he replied: "There was no sense." NOSENKO then went on
to explain that because he was only an average student and
because he was a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuitable

*Since April 1966, NOSENKO has said he joined the GRU in
1951, a year later.

by the KGB entry commission when he first applied in 1950.
Therefore, NOSENKO continued, he had been trying to conceal
this fact from CIA by moving events back a year, for he thought
CIA would not have believed him if he reported that he was
first rejected by the KGB and was later accepted.

2. Circumstances and Procedures of Entry

Although NOSENKO has consistently associated his entry into
the KGB with his discussions with General KOBULOV,* he has been
inconsistent concerning the content of their conversation, when
it occurred, its relationship in time to other events (see
Part IV.B.), and where it took place, at his father's dacha or
at KOBULOV's dacha. Also, whereas NOSENKO said in 1962 that
there were virtually no administrative formalities prerequisite
to his entry, he recalled in 1964 that he had had conversations
with various KGB personnel officers and (at home) had completed
a KGB questionnaire and a biographic form. NOSENKO was question-
ed at length on these points during 1964 and 1965. As a result,
he provided lengthy descriptions of his various interviews at
KGB Headquarters and of the questionnaire and other documents he
completed. In April 1966, however, NOSENKO reverted to his
original statement of 1962: There were no interviews with KGB
personnel officers, and he implied that he had filled out no
official forms. His various statements are presented in chrono-
logical order below.

9 June 1962: "KOBULOV was at our dacha. Well, he is a great
friend of my father. He was First Deputy to BERIYA, and my
father was Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry... A conversa-
tion simply began. He said: 'What are you doing?' I said: 'I'm
working in GRU. I worked in the Far East and now I'm working
on the Baltic. I came here on leave.' KOBULOV said: 'How do
you like the work?' I replied: 'Well, speaking honestly, I
don't like the work.' 'Well,' he said, 'You better come to work
with us. Where do you want to go? Into intelligence or counter-
intelligence?'... I did not want to go into intelligence. I
consider that only people who have seven, even ten years' ex-
perience in counterintelligence work should be sent to intelli-
gence. After this, let them go into positive intelligence. Then
they know how counterintelligence operates... Well, when KOBULOV
asked me where I wanted to work, I answered: 'It is better, of
course, to go into counterintelligence.' 'Well,' he said,
'Good. Look, drop in to see me for a minute sometime.' This
was simple conversation. Nothing official. A week later I
got a telephone call. They were calling from Personnel and
told me to stop by. I went. 'Come into this room,' they told
me/. 'it's not necessary to fill out a questionnaire (anketa).
We have already obtained your personal file from the GRU. Go
directly to the central entrance. A pass has already been
issued for you; the pass is already there. Go to the Secre-
tariat of Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV.' Well, I went. KOBULOV
had been summoned somewhere high up in the government, and his
assistant received me. 'How about working in the American De-
partment?' he [the assistant] asked. 'Well, good. Go there
right now.' Well, I went to the Second Directorate... His
KOBULOV's assistant sent me directly to the Second Directo-
rate, the American Department, the First Section, working with
American correspondents."

8 April 1964: "It was February (1953]. KOBULOV was in
Moscow." He was our friend. He said: 'O.K.,
George. I'll help you if you want, with the KGB.' I remember
exactly. Yes. It was in February. I saw him at the cottage...

By this time I had been in Moscow six weeks... KOBULOV was in
February. He went to see my father at the Ministry. It was
the end of the day. It was late and my father invited him to
come along to the summer home. It happened to be a Saturday.
KOBULOV's wife stayed in Germany. He was just here for a short
TDY. My father invited him to spend Saturday night and Sunday
at the dacha... On Sunday we were playing billiards and KOBULOV
asked me what I was doing. I told him "nothing,' that I was at
the disposal of the [GRU] Personnel Department. I said: 'I
don't want to go back to Baltiysk, to the Baltic Sea, because I
don't like the work there. I'm not doing anything there. I get
no satisfaction from the work.' He said: 'Well, you should be
utilized somehow... Do you want me to call the KGB Personnel
them look you over?' I told him: 'All right.' He called, and
he must have given our number to them, our home phone. I was
called subsequently by the Personnel Department of the KGB. In
February. They told me to come see them at House No. 12. They
had a pass for me... So I went. Picked up my pass and went...
[NOSENKO next gives a description of his route to the KGB build-
ing, his receipt of a pass, and his visit to the Central KGB
Personnel Office.] They talked to me. This man - I don't know
who or what he was - asked where I worked before and all that.
He said: 'O.K. We'll request your file from GRU. We will check
you out and will let you know whether or not we will take you.'
That's all." NOSENKO was asked whether he completed any forms
or questionnaires. "No. Not there. They gave me three copies
of forms to take home. There were so many questions. About my
parents, my education, my residences, addresses. I filled all
this out... Finally I completed all three copies and called
them. I was told that this time I would not need a pass, that
I should just go to the entrance, and the person (the personnel
officer] would come down and take the papers from me. I went,
brought the papers, and he took them from me, and also three
copies of my handwritten autobiography... Then I was called by
the personnel people once more. And at that time another
officer talked to me, and this time I knew who was talking to
me, because I was told to go to talk to ROZHENKO [first name
unknown, later identified as a Section Chief in the Personnel
Department]. This was in March... Just as soon as STALIN died,
KOBULOV came back from Germany immediately. He must have been
summoned by BERIYA or someone. And so, in just a few days
evidently he did not forget I got a call. It was Bogdan
Zakharovich's assistant. He told me to go to the central
entrance, that I didn't need a pass. I remember it as if it
just happened. I went in the uniform of a lieutenant, but with
a civilian overcoat. This was, maybe, the 10th of March... I
sat down [in KOBULOV's office]. I thought it would be for five
minutes. I waited there almost two hours. The assistant came
out a few times and told me that Bogdan Zakharovich is very,
very busy, but that he would give me an escort. Some senior
lieutenant came up to me and told me to follow him... We went
up to the sixth floor of the old building. I remember it as
though it just happened. I sat there about five or seven
minutes. Then I was told to go in. I announced myself. He
said: 'Yes, I know. Sit down. My name is SHUBNYAKOV, Fedor
Grigoryevich." He told me he was the Deputy Chief of the
Second Chief Directorate and that they had talked things over
and decided. He said that they wanted to offer me a position
in counterintelligence, in the First Department, the American

14-00000
91.

Department... Then he asked [A. M.] GORBATENKO to come in.
He was filling in for the Chief of the First Department...
He took me to his office... Well, they decided to put me in
the First U. S. Embassy/ Section and called Yevgeniy KOZLOV,
the Chief of the Section.. He came in and said: 'Well, hello,
Yuriy Ivanovich. I heard of you. Well, if you're finished
with him, I'll take him along with me and show him around.'
He took me and talked to me for a while and then told me to
report... Either the 12th or the 17th. I don't remember."

25 April 1964: NOSENKO again described the KGB question-
naire and autobiographic forms he had filled out at home and
recalled that he had also signed a secrecy agreement in the
personnel office. He also remembered that he had made several
additional phone calls to the KGB personnel office and described
his second visit there to talk to ROZHENKO: "At the end of
February I was told again to stop in the Pass Office and pick up
a pass and go to the same floor, but another room. They told me
I would have to talk to ROZHENKO today. He was a Chief of
Section, of the Personnel Section. So we had a talk. It was
the same thing again. He said: 'Tell me about yourself.' But
he just wanted to look me over. And after that they said: 'All
right, we have not gotten all your documents yet from your
military district. So wait.'"

26 April 1965: NOSENKO recounted his conversation with
KOBULOV, saying that it took place at KOBULOV's dacha in Usov,
where he and his parents were visiting in January 1953. NOSENKO
continued: "I was called at my family's dacha in February.
They said it was State Security calling and that I was to
report. I did this on the next day. Probably I then reported..
to House No. 12. As officer talked to me about my education,
service, and so on. Biographic questions. Then he gave me a
blank for my autobiography and a four to six-page anketa (bio-
graphic form). I filled these out at home. The next day I
called in and was told to come to the Eighth Entry. The officer
came down, and I gave him the forms and photographs of myself.
They said they would call me. I did nothing from January to
March. January was leave. In February and March I was at GRU
Personnel's disposal." After STALIN's funeral NOSENKO was
summoned to KOBULOV's office. His assistant, SAVITSKIY, told
NOSENKO to wait. After more than an hour had passed, SAVITSKIY
sent him to SHUBNYAKOV's office. There he learned that he would
be assigned to the U.S. Embassy Section and was introduced to
the Chief of the American Department, GORBATENKO. The official
order appointing NOSENKO was issued the same day, the 13th or
15th of March 1953.

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement: Again
NOSENKO said that he had spoken with KOBULOV at the KOBULOV
dacha and set the date at 1 January 1953. The document con-
tinued as follows: "I saw KOBULOV for the second and last time
on the day of STALIN's funeral in my father's office in the
Ministry of Shipbuilding in March 1953. I had come from the
sanitorium to Moscow and dropped in to see my father at work...
to the Dom Soyuzov for the funeral. KOBULOV said he would
concern himself with the question of my entry into the KGB.
The same day I returned to the sanitorium, and several days
later, having completed my treatment, I returned to Moscow.
In the middle of March, KOBULOV's assistant, Colonel SAVITSKIY,

called me at home and told me to come see KOBULOV. KOBULOV
didn't see me and SAVITSKIY directed me to the Deputy Chief
of the Second Chief Directorate, Colonel SHUBNYAKOV....
SHUBNYAKOV told me that an order had been signed appointing
me a case officer in the First Section of the First Depart-
ment, Second Chief Directorate. SHUBNYAKOV called the Chief
of the First Department, Lieutenant Colonel GORBATENKO, and
introduced me. Then I went to the First Department and was
introduced to the Deputy Chief of the First Department and the
Chief of the First Section, KOZLOV. KOZLOV said I would take
over the cases of Senior Case Officer, Captain Anatoliy
TORMOZOV and suggested that I begin work the same day. I was
accepted for work in the MVD in precisely this way. It is
necessary to note that none of the workers of the MVD Personnel
Administration spoke to me, either before or after the signing
of the order assigning me to the Second Chief Directorate of
the MVD."

C. June 1955 to January 1960 (American Department)

1. Introduction

Depending upon which date he has given for entering the KGB,
NOSENKO's first assignment in the U.S. Embassy Section of the
American Department, working on American correspondents living
in Moscow, lasted for about six to eighteen months. From that
job, he said, he moved in 1954 to operations against U.S. Mili-
tary Attaches assigned to the Moscow Embassy, remaining in the
same section until being transferred in June 1955. His activi-
ties, as NOSENKO described them, and pertinent collateral infor-
mation on his targets while he was in the U.S. Embassy Section
are reviewed below.

2. Operations Against Correspondents

On the day of his acceptance into the KGB, NOSENKO was
taken directly to the offices of the U.S. Embassy Section.
There he met the section chief, V.A. KOZLOV, who told NOSENKO
that he would take over the work of the departing case officer,
Captain Anatoliy TORMOZOV, in operations against American cor-
respondents in Moscow.

a. KGB Files on SHAPIRO, GILMORE, SALISBURY and WHITNEY

When NOSENKO reported for work the following day, accord-
ing to statements made on 8 April 1964, he found a desk in Room
615. "There were three other guys sitting there. At first I
was running traces, and at the same time I was reading the files
on journalists... I think there were seven files in all, and I
didn't see any other." NOSENKO listed these files as those on
Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy GILMORE (as well as one on GILMORE's wife
SEREBRYAKOVA and her sister CHERNYSHEVA), Harrison SALISBURY
and Thomas WHITNEY.*

During the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO identified
SHAPIRO as an "old agent of ours." He said that WHITNEY "worked
for us while he was in Moscow and gave us some material, but he
refused to work for us when he left the country and would not
contact us in the United States." GILMORE, NOSENKO said, was an
active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO did not
know whether he was recruited. Likewise, he did not know the
status of SALISBURY as of 1953.

NOSENKO stressed that the files he was given to read during
the early period of his KGB service were developmental files
(delo formulyar) rather than the operational files of the agents.
The developmental files were less sensitive, and from them "you
would never be able to figure out whether he [the subject of
the file] is an agent or not." NOSENKO explained that, once a
person becomes an agent, another file is set up, and these agent

* NOSENKO made clear that he was not the case officer responsi-
ble for the more important correspondents: "KOZLOV himself
was working with them, the chief of the section himself--with
SHAPIRO, with SHAPIRO's wife. I also know that KOZLOV was
working with WHITNEY and with [Andrew J.] STEIGER... For
each of these persons there was an operational file which I
did not see." According to NOSENKO, he was in no way involved
with STEIGER and Edmund STEVENS, both of whom were American
correspondents recruited as agents by the KGB.

files were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO
stated that he read the files on these seven persons "slowly
and made some extracts for myself in my personal log--such things
as notations of their dates of arrival, things I could not remem-
ber." He was also given the files on the agents surrounding
these correspondents, their drivers, maids, and cooks.

b. Agents Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible for handling the agents who
were reporting on SHAPIRO, WHITNEY, SALISBURY and the GILMOREs
and met with them regularly to learn whether "anything was new,
who did SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting in his behavior,
what might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contacting,
etc." He then reported to KOZLOV and would sometimes prepare a
written report of his conversations with the agents. Asked to
describe these meetings, NOSENKO replied: "Let us take the same
case of SHAPIRO. I would meet drivers about three times a month
or even two times. At the meeting I would ask the driver what
was new in SHAPIRO's behavior since our last meeting, whether
SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with foreigners, about his meet-
ings with Russians, were they conducted openly or, perhaps, was
SHAPIRO walking behind the person he met. And then the man
[agent] would begin his report. Of course, if he spots anything
suspicious he calls immediately, and I would see him the next
morning. Otherwise, I would tell him at the meeting that I
would see him again in about ten days or in two weeks, but if
there was something interesting he should call immediately.
It was the same with the maid and the cook. Upon returning to
the office I would have to report to KOZLOV about my meetings,
either orally or in writing. If, for example, [V.M.] KOVSHUK
[also of the U.S. Embassy Section) had a meeting with his agents,
he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni-
ent to both. If the meetings were taking place late in the day
and lasted until midnight or later and there were no written
materials submitted at the meeting, I could go home and then re-
port the next morning."

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various
agents surrounding the correspondents. "At first he was teach-
ing me. Then he would go in cases when something interesting
would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop
but when
