FYI:

1. AMDELL-1 spoke with AMRAZZ-1 on two separate occasions and learned the following information with the dates and sources as indicated.

2. AMRAZZ-1 spoke on 31 January 1965 with Sergio (LNU) who had just reached Miami from the Dominican Republic. Sergio stated that GUTIERREZ had gone to Cuba with three other men on 20 December 1964, landing near Baracoa, Oriente. The only members in this first infiltration were those arrested. GUTIERREZ had promised to contact his base by radio on 31 December 1964, but no message was ever received. Plans called for another group of about seven men to infiltrate into Cuba at Baracoa on or before 20 January 1965. The group left the Dominican Republic on 20 January according to plan. Near the Cuban coast, they were pursued by three Cuban patrol boats and one airplane but managed to escape. The boat used in both infiltration attempts was called the "Betrand" which may mean a Bortram boat.

3.
