REFERENCE : HMMA-41,734, 10 March 1972 (Previous Report)

INTRODUCTION

1. The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-

ments reported in other channels. This will be the last of the opera-

tional reports forwarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of

developments to date.

OPERATIONS

2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic

surveillance points (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the

MHHARSH installation. Operations from the KDLITERAL surveillance

point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on 7 July,

and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date. Operations

from the KDABSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the

equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his

family accomplished the same date.

ADMINISTRATION

3. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for

inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.

Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.

PERSONNEL

4. The project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2

operated the KDLITERAL basehouse, KDFACTOR-5 operated the KDABSINTHE

basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons

KDFACTOR-8 and -9. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in

their photo specialty since 1957.

5. KDFACTOR-2 will continue to reside in the KDLITERAL building,

as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in

December when he will move to new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL

building (MEXI-03, Unit 15) is part of the KDVAULT complex of build-

ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels. If this

occurs before December, KDFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.

6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDABSINTHE apart-

ment o/a 31 August. KDABSINTHE is located in a building owned by

KDABBEY who plans to dispose of his equity in the property in the

near future.

PRODUCTION

7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITERAL, through

KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover-

age of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He provided an average of three rolls

of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his

visual observation of the target area.

8. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced an

average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source for

information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially

"WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR

was also our main source of information on MHHARSH license plates

and automobiles.

9. In addition, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both provided detailed

"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. With the loss of this

combined coverage, it will be difficult to identity personnel assigned

to the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in

and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided

periodic photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with empha-

sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi-

tions made to the communications antenna system.

SECURITY

10. We were gratified to receive the very favorable Headquarters

KDFACTOR security review which was forwarded as HMMW-19,061, 28 June

1972. There is no need for further comment.

PROBLEMS

11. Only the developments reported in other channels.

FINANCES

12. KDFACTOR Project termination costs have been charged to

FY 1972 with the exception of rent payments and utility costs which

are being charged to FY 1973. The breakdown of agent termination

costs is as follows:

KDFACTOR-2 $102,000

KDFACTOR-5 29,575

KDFACTOR-6 35,380

KDFACTOR-8 8,112

OPERATIONS

1. The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six

months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points

(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside

administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.

Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate

case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-

sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo

product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now

been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery

to the consumer has been speeded up.

PERSONNEL

3. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2

operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-

city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with

the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8

and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since

1957.

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual

observation of the target area.

5. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced

100 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-

mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-

tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.

This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of

information on MHHARSH License plates and automobiles.

6. KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed

"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined

coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to

the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements and

activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic

photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with emphasis on

coverage of any construction changes and any modification or additions

made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also

available to service special support requests as required. During

the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and

a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.

SECURITY REVIEW

7. There were no known problems of security relating to the

project. In response to Reference B. request, we have reviewed all

phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.

The project assets have all been with us for many years and have

established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the

area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are

extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed. The assets

derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their BKTRUST

employment and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever

necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional

safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented

from each other, and there has never been any indication that either

segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.

8. The only termination of a project asset in recent years was

KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both

surveillance points. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated amicably in March

1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,

KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access

agents. KDFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of

friends, and on a number of recent occasions he has been very helpful

when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background

information on people in the medical profession. Although KDFACTOR-1

processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact

surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished

product was always accomplished by an outside case officer.

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets,

KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of

their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met weekly

to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing

and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick-

ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs. Meetings with

KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his

route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long

enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,

rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at

the Station and have been forwarded to Headquarters on both KDFACTOR-

2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-5's imme-

diate family and could be contacted through him using his emergency

plan.

10. We have taken action recently to guard against the contin-

gency that one of the present sites might be blown, and alternate

means might be required to continue the KDFACTOR coverage. In

February 1972 an apartment became available in the same building

complex which houses the KDABSINTHE installation. Through the

cooperation of KDABBEY-1, we were able quictly to rent the apart-

ment and install elements of the KDCALVERT team as residents. This

location affords as good, if not better, vantage point for continu-

ing photo coverage in the event the present KDABSINTHE location

becomes untenable. We are also exploring alternate locations for

KDLITERAL to solve the problem we face with this element of KDFACTOR

coverage (see below).

PROBLEMS

11. The only known problem cofnected with the project is a

product of mother nature which is threatening the effectiveness of

KDLITERAL coverage. Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel

planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to

the garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the

point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator, estimates he only

has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying

ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch

to Headquarters on the topic in the near future.

FINANCES

12. There have been no changes in anticipated project expenses

shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973.

EVALUATION

14. The support provided by the KDFACTOR Project to the Station

REDTOP Program is indispensable. We believe the project represents

a professional collection effort being run securely and successfully

against a sensitive target with a minimal expenditure of funds and

case officer time.

*Reflects anticipated salary raises and higher rent on MEXI-132 based

meetings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.

FERNALD who had previously handled the assets. When ARCHBOLD de-

parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS assumed his responsi-

bilities. MANKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FERNALD left

on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project

assets in the future.

3. Processing of the photo product is now accomplished inside

the Station by Phemia B. CHAUVEAU. KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all

the processing in an outside safehouse/darkroom, was terminated

amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility

was turned over to CHAUVEAU. The new arrangement has proven to be

more than satisfactory. Agent meetings have now been cut to a

minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery to the con-

sumer has been speeded up considerably.

PERSONNEL

4. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2

operates the KDLITERAL base house and has been employed in this

capacity since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE base house
