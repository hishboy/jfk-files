1. On 4 January 1963 AMHINT-27 met with QUANTUM-51 in New York City, and QUANTUM-51 advised him that Jorge MEDINA Bringuier, the Secretary General of AMSPELL in PBRUMEN, is a G-2 agent. MEDINA and HAEDO (fnu), who was said by QUANTUM-50 to be on the AMSPELL National Executive, were actually G-2 penetrations. They planned to "roll up" the entire AMSPELL organization and "other groups" in one sweep and then escape by boat and contact AMHINT-53 in the JMWAVE area. MEDINA was in contact with AMHINT-53 while in PBRUMEN and planned to use AMHINT-53 to establish his bona fides with KUBARK.

2. [QUANTUM-51] further advised that another mission of the two G-2 agents, MEDINA and HAEDO, was to make contact with Iden A to determine what role it played in anti-CASTRO activities. The secretary of QUANTUM-50 had been a very close personal friend of HAEDO's since childhood and HAEDO feared she would be implicated, so he told her of his espionage mission. She informed [QUANTUM-51] and then arranged a meeting between QUANTUM-51 and HAEDO. HAEDO told QUANTUM-51 of his mission and arrangements were then made to get all the AMSPELL leaders into asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy. On or about 10 December 1962 about 25 persons, including HAEDO, went into asylum.

3. QUANTUM-51 further said that HAEDO reportedly was arrested by G-2 a long time ago and then recruited to work for the PBRUMEN Government.

4. Reference C is a chronological summary of AMHINT-33's activities subsequent to his infiltration in PBRUMEN, and his contacts with Chelin, the brother of AMFRET-7. AMFRET-7's arrest was reported in Reference B. The AMFRET-7 Case Officer states that both AMFRET-7 and his brother were arrested, after shooting it out with G-2 and being wounded. As noted in Reference D, AMFRET-7's arrest was made after [QUANTUM-55] and Blanca MARTINEZ de Hoya, aka "Cuca," aka "Cuchi," brought MEDINA, AMSPELL's National Military Coordinator for Reception and Supply, to Iden A where MEDINA recognized AMHINT-33. AMHINT-33 said MEDINA was an old friend of his and had lived near him.

RE G-2 PENETRATION
Against AMSPELL

5. AMHINT-33 said further that his brother knows MEDINA, that MEDINA is the man whom AMHINT-33 used in 1961 to check up on REBELLON (fnu), the FEU Secretary General in PBRUMEN. AMHINT-33 added in his S/W Message 11 of 10 December 1962 that "his friends" are still in jail.

6. Reference E transmitted a letter written by AMHINT-33 on 29 December 1962 in which he states that G-2 infiltration is so great that he considers it impossible to organize anything, and he indicates that some of the agents, as in this case, have been infiltrated for more than two years. He presumably means infiltrated into anti-CASTRO organizations and/or activities.

7. Relative to the "other groups" mentioned in para. 1 above, AMHINT-33's Case Officer believes that AMHINT-33 is probably referring to the MRR, the MRP, the MDC and the 30th of November groups. The "friends" mentioned in Para. 5 may be one Eduardo BRINGAS, who is about 23 years of age, one GOUMI (fnu), and others previously referred to but not identified by AMHINT-33; they may have worked for AMHINT-33.

RE G-2 PENETRATION OF

8. JMWAVE traces on the individuals involved in this plot offer little concrete information.

a. It is noted that Jorge MEDINA Bringuier is listed on Page 13 of Attachment C to UFGA-4977 as an MRR member, with a listed aka of Carlos PRADO. JMWAVE tracing identifies one Carlos PRADO as "a brother of Raul, the head of G-2 in Las Villas Province," as reported in HAVA-6437, 5 October 1960; there is no further information on this Carlos PRADO. However, the original source of the information given in Attachment C of UFGA-1977 was a letter brought out of PBRUMEN by AMSTRUT-1 about early July 1962. Said letter contained a $25 money order, issued at Station No. 9, New Orleans, on 16 March 1962, for Jorge MEDINA Bringuier and purchased by Maria Teresa MEDINA. The envelope, addressed to Sra. Consuelo C. de RIVAS in Mexico City, bore the notation, "For Carlos PRADO," and contained a note, "This money order for $25 is for Carlos PRADO from his mother," in addition to the money order. There is one Carlos PRADO in Mexico. He is studying engineering and is the brother of Faustino PRADO Garcia, an engineer who works close to "Che" GUEVARA and is of current KUTUBE interest. Faustino PRADO is married to Clara ARTIME, a sister of Josefina ARTIME, who is a close friend of AMGLEN-9, and she is also of current KUTUBE interest. When AMSTRUT-2, who could have given this letter to AMSTRUT-1 to take out of PBRUMEN, was in Mexico City she called Carlos PRADO by telephone at 249769 and told him that she was a friend of his mother. This PRADO family is a large one, and includes another brother, Angel, who is in Spain, a sister who is a nun in Italy, and another brother who is a doctor in New York City. Additional data could be secured on this family from AMSTRUT-2 if desired. However, it seems probable that this money order may have been sold in Cuba by Jorge MEDINA and purchased, sooner or later, by the mother of the Carlos PRADO who is currently a student in Mexico. A copy of the material carried out by AMSTRUT-1 is being forwarded herewith. It will be noted that a part of the attachment was disseminated as UFG-1239, 13 July 1962.

b. It is further noted that JMWAVE files show one "Mongo" listed on Page 14 of Attachment C to UFGA-4977 as captured and sentenced to 30 years in prison. This information came from UFG-779, 12 January 1962, which was based on an ANCUTLER-1 intercept of a report from the MRR Acting Internal Coordinator in PBRUMEN to Hipolito LAZARO, the MRR Internal Coordinator temporarily in PBPRIME, sent via the Argentine Diplomatic Pouch. There was no further identification of this "Mongo."

c. It is noted that Reference F identifies Jorge HAEDO as a former anti-Castrista who was tortured and doubled by the PBRUMEN Government; HAEDO appears to be the correct spelling.

d. "Cuca" or "Cuchi" MARTINEZ, who has held the position of AMSPELL National Coordinator for Civil Resistance, is a personal friend of AMCOG-3 and family. She is believed to have taken asylum in the Mexican Embassy. SW Message 12 from AMCOG-3, dated 8 December 1962 and received 12 December, reported that QUANTUM-51 advised "Cuca" to hide or be cautious because MEDINA had turned out to be a G-2 member. The message said that this was learned from AMSPELL prisoners and that, during interrogation, they were asked many questions about "Cuca" and AMCOG-2.

9. When the AMHINT-53 security review mentioned in Reference A is received, additional investigation as necessary will be made at JMWAVE.

I am going to place the communication abroad in Sofi's hands; no one betrays. What I need is that you explain to us better how to make the contact from here over there, that is, how and where to see SARADIA, the contact which you said you had with Min. Sofi knows him but doesn't know where she can see him. Remember that Sofi is already being checked because Esteban's wife knows her and asked about her. I am going to try to have the treasurer be a friend of Sofi's who knows where the money is. To is a fully trustworthy boy called Alejandro.

Tell Dr. LAZAGA that I don't write to him about the affair because it is easier for me to write to you, but that he and this boy should have relations, and I with Ciald and with you.

Give the support to LAZAGA together with the Executive, because it would be impossible to only one person, and for the case it was left in our hands. You see that the executive over there is fully answerable to us and that way there will be no problems.

We don't know anything about my namesake. So far all the contacts have failed. Let's see what we can clarify.

Tell Tomas that the news I sent him about Don Nios was through a contact which I made with our brother-in-law D. He is willing to work and has people in his area, and also in the coast. I believe that a lot can be done up there. Besides, Sato left me a terrific contact also at that coast, whom we have to put in contact with D. Tell Tomas to let me work also in that area, which is mine and of my people, and that if he gives authorization that we can send a guerrilla band to work with that. Of course, this guerrilla chosen by us to avoid their sending people of the and have them take command away from us. You know how that is.

Write to our other brother-in-law in the embassy and find out when he leaves because I know that he is already leaving but to come back to me immediately. Let's see if he leaves, takes a fast training, and comes back. Have them get much map reading and man to man combat with bayonets which is very good at night and no one here knows anything about that.

You must explain the thing a bit to Boto so that he will gain enthusiasm. If he sees that the thing is serious and has real support he will come. The only thing that late Hugo, he needs support for his family. Explain everything to him and I think he will come. Mariana already gave him your phone. If he needs money for his wife and for himself give it to him from mine. I authorized him to ask you for it.

If they would let me, in our province I would place 4 or 5 guerrillas with the contacts which I had before and have now, and we would fill that up for these people, that is, we would start a war in all the province, plains and everything.

Well, this letter is going with safe hands to Himni where it will be mailed tomorrow. The S.V. which I sent will arrive later if I can't get it taken with this one because I already gave it to have it mailed. Let's see if we can get it back in time to have it arrive soon.

I will write to Boba and Martha Elena another day with calm, and I don't have the details of your letters on hands.

Regards to all and you receive love from your brother,

Xmoles

In the City of Havana, on 30 June 1962, the members of the NATIONAL EXECUTIVE of the "MOVIMIENTO DE RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA" (M.R.R.), Rigoberto CASAS, Civilian National Coordinator, and Jose Antonio AGRONTE, Military National Coordinator, had a meeting and adopted the following agreements:

1st: That in view of the present situation of our movement and the general situation of the country, we have decided to change the organization of the movement, which will now be composed as follows: (A) One Civilian National Coordinator, and (B) One Military National Coordinator, leaving without effect all the previous Secretariats and denominations.

2nd: To give full autonomy, with regard to functioning, to the Civilian and Military Coordinations. Thus, each will function separately.

3rd: To give full support and recognition as GENERAL DELEGATE in exile of our movement, to Dr. Jose Ignacio LAZAGA and to the executive appointed by him with the authorization of the previous National Coordination.

4th: As a result of the SECOND agreement regarding autonomy in the functioning of the National Coordinations, we agree to accept the hierarchy in the command of the full Executive of our Movement in exile, with the provision that the orders originating from this Executive will be complied with in accordance with our capabilities and taking into consideration that as we are in the National Territory we have better knowledge of the real situation which we are undergoing.

Signed by Rigoberto CASAS and Jose Antonio AGRONTE exclusively, as the rest of the members of the previous NATIONAL COORDINATION are in prison with the exception of Mr. Pello, ex Coordinator of Civic Resistance who is in asylum.
