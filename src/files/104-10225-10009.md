[2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992]

SECRET
7 March 1975

MEMO FOR THE FILE
Meeting with PACHANKIS 3 March 1975, 1345-1500, Restaurant at
the Marriot Motel near National Airport

PACHANKIS stated that our old agent Miguel DIAZ Isalgue
was having trouble getting his U.S. citizenship approved. DIAZ
had sent in all the papers and I&NS told him the only thing
left was the swearing in. So DIAZ waited a year and a half
and I&NS never called him in. He called them in November 1974
and was told that there were no problems; that he would be called.

The DIAZ file shows that I&NS requested our traces in
December 1974. IP/EIB sent them; there may be something in
that is causing a problem now though that doesn't explain the
year delay before.

On 6 March, I told PACHANKIS to have DIAZ call I&NS one more
time and if there is a real problem, we'd see what we could
do.
