...I met him, I only saw him on the TV a few months ago, he looks like a broken man, he did that day anyway. But he was a very mysterious, very --

MR. OLSEN: To use the house term, he was a spook?

MR. MARCHETTI: Yes. He was a very exotic character. And all kinds of stories float around about Jim Angleton. And I am sure that some are nothing more than apocryphal and some are pure rumor.

What intrigued me about this Runge thing is that subsequently another reporter -- and this time the guy identified the man he had been talking to -- the man he had been talking to was Bill Harvey, who was one of the people responsible for exposing Philby, in fact Philby gives Harvey the credit in his book under a pseudonym -- that Harvey said to this reporter -- yes, the Agency has been penetrated, it may even be now -- he made some pompous statements of that nature. But then when the guy tried to dig deeper, Harvey held him at arm's length.

MR. OLSEN: Who is Harvey?

MR. MARCHETTI: Bill Harvey was a scenario officer. He had been, among other thing Chief of Base, in Berlin during the Cold War. He had been Head of the Cuban task force.

MR. OLSEN: Which Cuban task force do you refer to now? The one that was organized --

MR. MARCHETTI: Within the Agency, the Agency's own.

Soviet defectors and people who claim to be and have subsequently been found to be legitimate defectors.

MR. MARCHETTI: You mean found to be illegitimate defectors?

MR. OLSEN: No, found to be legitimate defectors -- well, either way.

MR. MARCHETTI: Well, they would turn up from time to time. Usually I didn't have any direct dealings. They were handled by the Clandestine Services. But you would know the case. There is the famous case of (?), who is this Polish intelligence who said that he was a KGB plant and he is the one that many people on the extreme right like to point to as having identified all kinds of agents within the US Government. Eventually I got to the tsaravitch, he had survived the shooting, the legal claim and the throne. At this point you don't know if the guy was nuts all along, and I don't know what the official thinking about it at the Agency is. But there have been a number of others over the years. There is Colonewaki --

MR. OLSEN: How do you spell his name.

MR. MARCHETTI: These names are a matter of record. You will have

...defectors which you believe to be questionable as to whether or not it comes within the charter of the CIA?

MR. MARCHETTI: No. As I say, I have no first hand knowledge on this subject.

MR. OLSEN: Yes. You remember the case? You mentioned that in your book, I believe, don't you?

MR. MARCHETTI: I was in the Agency at the time that happened, but I knew practically nothing about it in the Agency. For one reason, I didn't pay any attention to it. I had no reason to. But it was after getting out of the Agency. This happened to be a case where Rouse, under Agency orders, was directed to Mingas being a Soviet agent in the Estonian group. And now apparently to this day claims absolute innocence, and said that he was framed, and it was done for other reasons, because he didn't see eye to eye with the Agency.

MR. OLSEN: You don't know the story behind that, I take it?

MR. MARCHETTI: No. But you could find out. I don't know what the Agency was doing. All I know is that Helms submitted some sort of affidavit which the judge accepted, and on the basis of that the case was resolved in favor of Rouse. He had to identify Rouse as being in the Agency's employ and acting under orders from the Agency. The reasons why, they are...

...seem to work properly except in the US. And I am wondering what kind of use in the US you might be aware of?

MR. MARCHETTI: That wasn't what I meant by that. What I meant was, it worked good under laboratory conditions here, but when I would take it out to the field, it wouldn't work.

MR. ROETHE: You weren't referring to any use of these beams here in the US?

MR. MARCHETTI: No, I was not. But that is that system that people are talking about now, the laser people bugging system, where they can get a building across the street there and direct a beam here and pick it up. It has become quite popular in recent years, at least they talk about it.

MR. OLSEN: You mean in the spy literature?

MR. MARCHETTI: Yes.

MR. ROETHE: At page 196 you refer to monitoring of embassy traffic from Maryland and Virginia. Were you referring to CIA's activity in monitoring, or NSA?

MR. MARCHETTI: (NSA)

MR. ROETHE: You are not aware of any CIA activity of this nature?

MR. MARCHETTI: No, not here in this country. In fact, the only case that I was aware of overseas that the did it, if they did it at all, they did it because NSA...

...certain political reasons, the Government didn't want NSA in there, the military personnel.

MR. ROETHE: There is one reference to breaking into embassies at page 199. And there is no reference to any particular embassy. Are you aware of any activity where the CIA was actually implicated in breaking into an embassy? You have already talked about the Chilean Embassy.

MR. MARCHETTI: This was based on information that was available in the Houston Plan, which by that time had become public. And also certain background information about the capabilities of the NSA in its technical field, and certain CIA clandestine abilities. And it was all rolled into one as a supposition.

MR. ROETHE: On page 207 you indicate that many individuals at CIA were pressing for action against the KGB in the US as the FBI was not doing a good enough job?

MR. MARCHETTI: Yes.

MR. ROETHE: Do you know of any actual operations that were ever taken by the CIA, or do you have any evidence of such operations?

MR. MARCHETTI: No, I do not.

MR. ROETHE: On page 216 you refer to training of New and Chicago police. What kind of training are you referring to, or do you know?

MR. MARCHETTI: That is just it. I am not exactly sure...
