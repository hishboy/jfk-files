1. Station passed referenced information to Customs
on 13 September 1973. Initial checks by the Station with
the FBI, DEA, and Customs revealed no information on the
individuals mentioned in reference (Donald Henry,
John Brooks and Wilbur). Customs was
in agreement with the Station's suggestion that a Customs
telephone number should be passed to Henry and the case
should be put into Customs hands.
2. Henry called Customs on 13 September 1973. A meeting
was arranged for that afternoon, before the meeting took
place; however, a Customs officer recognized the name of
Henry was thus met by two Customs officers.
Brooks as possibly being one of his contacts. On returning from their
meeting, the Customs officers notified the Station, and a
meeting was arranged to see them on 14 September 1973.
Customs provided the following information on Donald Henry.
a. Donald Henry is about 52 years old. He is from
Michigan. He lived and went to school in Canada.
He has resided in the
Keys for about seven years. He moved
to Florida about fifteen years ago.
b. Henry was described by Customs as a braggart.
They felt, however, that his offer of assistance was genuine.
Customs stated that Henry always had a quick answer for any
question asked of him, but when the questions got down to
specifics his answers were vague.
c. Contrary to initial information, Henry does not
have a boat or an airplane. Customs noted, though, that
Henry probably has easy access to one. Neither does Henry
have an FAA license for flying multi-engine aircraft, although
he told Customs he was capable of flying them.

for about a year. (John Wilbur is described in further
detail below.) Henry said he met Wilbur through their
association with the Atlantis Dive Center, Inc., Miami,
Florida, where Wilbur is employed and where Henry has had
a working relationship for some time. The Atlantis Dive
Center is owned by one Healey Ricard (no Station
traces). Ricard, Customs reported, is an unsavory character
involved in smuggling activities and would not hesitate to
shoot anyone who gets in his way.

Henry told Customs that when he bumped into Wilbur
at the Atlantis Dive Center recently, they started talking
about various ways they could make money. Wilbur told Henry
that he (Henry) could smuggle arms over to Abaco,
and they started discussing that possibility. During the
conversation, Henry asked Wilbur who he would be working
for. Wilbur mentioned the name of Bobo Brown. Wilbur also
told Henry that Brown, an ex-Special Forces U.S. Army Major,
had set up a branch of Defense Systems, Inc., on Abaco for
Mitchell L. WerBell, III. Wilbur also intimated that
RHERALD was aware of the operation and condoned it. Customs
noted that Henry did not pick up the name Bobo or Brown
until after they had mentioned a Special Forces major, at which
point Henry professed to remember his name.

e. Henry also told Customs, when asked why he had
called RHERALD, that he had telephoned the FBI first and
was told by them that his information was not in their juris-*
diction and was given the phone number for RHERALD. Later,
Henry changed his story to the effect that he said he looked
in the Miami telephone directory to get the FBI's number and
called RHERALD instead because the latter's number
was under the FBI's. (Comment: Not true, both numbers are
listed under U.S. Government but on separate pages.)

3. As for John Brooks, Customs reported that this name
is an alias used by one John Wilbur, who is about 35 years
old. Originally from Massachusetts, Wilbur has been in Florida
for several years. He has been in touch with Customs for
approximately three years. He was initially brought to
Customs' attention over a narcotics case. At the time,
Wilbur was working/informing for the FBI, infiltrating both
right and left wing youth organizations. He was also dating
an airline stewardess who was involved in narcotics smuggling
from South America. When Wilbur found out about this illegal
activity, he told the FBI who, in turn, put him in touch with
Customs.

f. Customs described Wilbur as an ultra-right winger and
a soldier-of-fortune who is impressive looking and a smooth
talker. Customs said Wilbur is also a fabricator. As an
example, they mentioned that Wilbur would read an article
in a magazine and shortly thereafter would try to pass it
off as his information. He would also contact Customs and
tell them every rumor he heard in the hopes that one of the
stories would be true so that he could collect a reward.
Customs said that although Wilbur is a fabricator and rumor
collector, he is dangerous and would do anything for money.

Customs noted that Wilbur enjoys playing the role of
a big shot with important contacts and likes to flash copies around.
Customs also noted that Wilbur had been living
with a rich divorcee. Wilbur is in the real-estate business
and inherited property in the Keys (worth $1 million) from
his family. Customs stated that she receives about $1500 a
month in

alimony and supposedly has about $400,000 in the bank.
She has set Wilbur up in an apartment and furnishes him with
spending money. Customs also said that Wilbur seems to be
sort of paranoid in that he constantly mentions RHERALD,
not naming RHERALD as such but referring to it as the
company, the driving force behind democracy, and so
forth.

g. According to Customs, Wilbur began working for
Underwater Sports of America, Miami, Florida, as a salesman
in the early 1960's. At the time, reported Customs, Under-
water Sports was engaged in contractual work for RHERALD
concerning training during preparations for the Bay of Pigs.
The last contact Customs had with Wilbur was about three weeks
ago. They plan to see him again in the next few days and
will attempt to get his side of the story.

7. Customs stated that in spite of the inconsistencies
in Henry's story they felt he was making a legitimate offer
to assist and thus advised him to proceed along the following
lines:
a. Re-contact Wilbur and tell him that he was
prepared to fly arms to Abaco, but he would have to see the
"front money" first. Customs commented that if Wilbur
produces the money, they would have a case; if not, the whole
episode could probably be chalked up to Wilbur's delusions.
b. After re-contacting Wilbur and if Wilbur comes up
with the money, Henry should attempt to convince him of the
necessity of a dry run. If a dry run is not possible, then
he is to go ahead with the operation. Arrests would be made
by Customs in the States after the arms have been placed in
the aircraft and after the personnel involved have boarded
the plane.

8. Customs has promised to keep the Station apprised of
the case, especially as it pertains to the Bahamas and other
areas in the Caribbean.

na weapons given to him by friendly
forces in Vietnam, he said, and they
were shipped to the States for display
in military museums.

Not surprisingly, WerBell has often
been called an operative of the
Central Intelligence Agency, a charge
that angers him only when it is lev-
eled too vehemently. It is not that
he has anything against the CIA. He
just doesn't, he says, happen to be
one of its boys. His paramilitary work,
which consists of advising and some-
times directly assisting foreign gov-
ernments, is done in the employ of
what he calls an independent group
of well-intentioned, patriotic Ameri-
cans. The Birch Society? The Min-
utemen? A bunch of far-right Texas
millionaires? WerBell won't say, other
than to insist that it is not the CIA.

It hardly matters, for according to
WerBell, it is all in the service not only
of freedom and anti-communism but
of the U.S. government; he does not
supply or advise or fight for regimes
not bearing the State Department seal
of approval. A heavy percentage of his
merchandise goes directly to the U.S.
government, which distributes it to its
own forces that need silent or exotic
weapons. The balance is sold to
friendly governments, either directly
or through the good offices of the "in-
dependent group." He says he does not
sell to individuals, not even if they're
certified anticommunists.

WerBell takes pains to point out that
he is no ordinary arms broker. That is,
he is not one of those shadowy figures
who sell weapons to both sides at exor-
bitant prices or who take possession of
contraband shipments on the high seas.
"We've always adhered to a basic pol-
icy: There is only one friend of the
United States in a given area, and we
deal only with that friend."

What does WerBell peddle? A range
of firearms from machine guns to
desk-sized cannons, from the meanest-
looking weapons to innocent looking
swagger sticks that fire a bullet or
even a small rocket; an array of tech-
niques - "systems," he calls them -
that will help an American soldier or a
foreign army hold off insurgent forces,
and occasionally, his personal services.

These services present WerBell at
his most shadowy. Serving as a com-
batant in the armed forces of a foreign
nation is against U.S. law, and WerBell
is understandably reluctant to admit
having done so. He describes himself
in such terms as "paramilitary" and
"adviser," but acquaintances suspect
he has been in the thick of the fighting
a number of times. He may even have
zapped an insurgent or two.

Corporate Setup

NE HADQUARTERS
F-
4.15
In Operational Negation of Insurgency
and Countersubversion, tied in with
Environmental Industries, and began
in earnest to develop a line of military
hardware. Sons Mitch IV and Geoff be-
came integral parts of the firm. Mitch
IV was already a bona fide counter-
insurgent. As a 15-year-old, he had
spent considerable time with Dad in
the Dominican Republic, specializing
in underwater probing for safe landing
sites. Geoff, two years younger, barely
missed out on a Cuban foray; his
father took him to Miami a few years
ago, but the plans fell through.

One day I sat in WerBell's office as
Geoff displayed a number of Military
Armament's most unusual weapons. He
brought out "the Stinger," a cigar-
shaped tube three inches long, weigh-
ing only 2 ounces, that fires a .22 caliber
cartridge. Nothing visible suggests a
gun, and the bullet, on its way
out, dislodges a thin plug that dis-
guises the hole at the end of the tiny
barrel. WerBell commends the Stinger
to secret agents who get caught with
the goods and must take the last re-
sort," that is, shoot themselves.

In the same exotic category is the
swagger stick, bound in leather, with
silver studs. By pushing between two
studs, one can fire a .22 or, with a spe-
cial model, a small rocket. The body-
guard of Dominican strongman Gen.
Antonio Imbert used the rocket model
to blast would-be assassins a few years
ago. Then there is a small, brass-fitted
cannon. It makes a handsome knick-
knack for a soldier-politician's desk. It
fires, with one simple finger move-
ment, a bullet that will quiet an unruly
visitor. More traditionally military is
WerBell's special long-range knocker,
a redesigned Remington 9-
millimeter rifle that "will plug 'em in
the eye at 200 meters."

The bulk of WerBell's business is in
sound suppressors and Ingram Model
submachine guns. Suppressors can be
used on large as well as small weap-
ons, and in fact have been used effec-
tively on the wicked-looking Vulcan
machine guns mounted on American
helicopters in Vietnam. The Australian
Army Journal ran a story calling the
Sionics suppressor "superior to any-
thing previously used... (with it) it is
now possible for the sniper to fire
from relatively short ranges, especially
when using subsonic projectiles."

WerBell is so enthusiastic about the
Ingram Model submachine guns (there
are two models, taking different sized
cartridges) that he predicts they will
eventually make "obsolete every indi-
vidual weapon in the world." The U.S.
Army, he says, is now looking care-
fully at the Ingram models with an eye
toward making them standard equip.

WerBell hit the
dedicated to killing people. Environ-
mental Industries, WerBell says, is
bankrolled by some of the East's most
prominent investment houses; he is its
director of international operations.
He is also president of a subsidiary
called Military Armaments Co., Inc.,
and because he is in Powder Springs,
Military Armaments is there, too. (B
hind Environmental Industries, Wer-
Bell says, is "a third shadow of which
E.I. is a subsidiary"-another tantaliz-
Ing hint of the CIA.)

Military Armaments may well be a
unique American enterprise. Nobody
else, WerBell says, is in the business
of designing special purpose weapons
on such a scale. A good deal of its de-
signing and manufacturing is done
under federal license. Silencers, for ex-
ample, are outlawed by the National
Firearms Act, along with sawed-off
shotguns, submachine guns and other
vestiges of Prohibition era gangland
wars.

To manufacture his suppressors,
WerBell must pay a special tax of $500
a year, collected by the Treasury
Department. The T-men also check pe-
riodically to see that his awesome
collection of firearms-over 200 indi-
vidual pieces-is properly registered.
Apparently the market for suppressors
is not very large because, according to
WerBell, his firm is the only one au-
thorized to manufacture them.

WerBell will not discuss the sales or
profits of Military Armaments except
to say that, after two years of exten-
sive research and development (result-
ing in a tax loss of a half million dol-
lars"), the company is now doing very
well. It has about 12 employees, includ-
ing four machinists who work under
the direction of Gordon Ingram, who
has charge of the design operation and
whose name is on the Model 11 subma-
chine gun that young Mitch demon-
strated on the firing range.

*Cottage Industry'

INGRAM WORKS in a well-equipped
machine shop-lab attached to the
main house on the estate, which Wer-
Bell likes to call "the farm." Werbell's
office is next door to the shop. Its walls
are so loaded with weapons that it is a
wonder they do not collapse. There are
knives and spear guns and pistols and
rifles and machine guns, dozens and
dozens of them, some purchased, some
won in combat, some presented by the
appreciative recipients of WerBell's
counterinsurgency techniques.

WerBell, who has a sense of humor,
calls his enterprise a "cottage indus-
try" and likens himself to "a country
doctor... I can fall out of the living
area upstairs right down to the office."
Upstairs is the domain of his German-
born wife Hildegard, a pleasant,
gray-haired woman who has borne
weapons for the U.S. Army and other counterinsur-
WerBell six children and put up with
his rather unusual way of life. (When
he left for the Far East in 1968, he said
he'd be gone for a year or more, and
he was.)

A Military Profile

[ITCHELL WERBELL is a short,
wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
talking about communism or other so-
cial issues. He has the face and bear-
ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a mustache and
occasionally a morocle. He often
dresses in military clothing of indeter-
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking in slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
phrases. There is nothing phony in
this. WerBell has a strong attachment
to weapons and to warfare, and he has
been around them so long that the
ideas and styles they foster are an in-
grained part of his personality.

He comes by both his militarism and
his anticommunism honestly. His
father was an officer in the Russian
Imperial army, even though he was
born in the United States. "It was a
tricky situation," says Mitch. "He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days you could do that."

The elder WerBell fought against
the Bolsheviks, but before the collapse
of the czarist regime he wisely secured
an appointment as liaison officer be-
tween the Russian and American
forces stationed in the U.S. He lived
in this country for the rest of his life,
putting his early medical training to
use in cancer research.

A legacy from father is Mitch's
barely disguised aristocratic sympa-
thies. He has been quoted as saying
"Communism is a substitution of a
peasant dictatorship over the aristocra-
cy. I prefer the aristocracy." He is
without question an elitist. Not surpris-
ingly, his elite is composed of superpa-
triots and military men.

Mitchell WerBell was born in Penn-
sylvania, shortly after his Russian-
American father and his Scottish-born
mother arrived in the U.S. at the end
of World War I. His parents traveled a
good deal, here and abroad, and Mitch
traveled with them, picking up his edu-
cation as he went. He got a degree in
journalism from the University of
Pennsylvania. In World War II, he
joined the OSS, and served with a unit
behind Japanese lines in China, rising
to the rank of captain and acquiring
a taste for guerrilla-type warfare he
would never lose.

WerBell moved to Atlanta shortly
after the war and went to work in ad-
Wer Bell recovered from a leg injury.
vertising in a department store. Soon
he was head of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own.

In the mid-'50s, WerBell pulled out
of his agency and then formed his
own public relations firm. "I'd already
been drifting into international PR,"
WerBell says, "using my family back-
ground. I had tremendous contacts in
Europe, and I moved into the Far
East, too." How much of this moving
in was military, WerBell won't say,
but his business took on more and
more of what he calls a "geopolitical"
flavor.

Before long, he was dabbling in
Latin American dictatorships. "Before
Fidel took over in Cuba, we were
working closely with Batista." He adds
with a grin, "Our function was to keep
Batista in power, although the U.S.
government was looking favorably on
Fidel at that point."

From all this, even WerBell doesn't
know exactly how, came a passionate
concern about communism. "I decided
to devote whatever time I could to
anticommunist activities," he says.
"At first it was sort of a hobby, but
then it became my main drive in life.
What I'm doing now"-here he ges-
tures at the arsenal on his office walls
"affords me a damned good living.
But the living is not why I do it."

The Heart of It

IN 1948, WHILE anticommunism was
still a hobby, albeit a paying hobby,
WerBell purchased the Dobbs estate.
He installed rudimentary design facili-
ties and began experimenting with
weapons of counterinsurgency, weap-
ons he believed had the best chance of
preventing Communist takeovers in
the small, underdeveloped nations of
Asia and Latin America. "I realized
that in counterinsurgency, the pri-
mary problem was a lack of depth in
weaponry. People say, 'Win the hearts
of the enemy, and you'll win the fight.'
That's a lot of bull. The best way to
get their hearts, if they're the enemy,
is to shoot 'em and cut the hearts
out."

While he experimented with weap-
ons quietly, to avoid problems with
the federals-WerBell proceeded with
his personal brand of geopolitics. He
made himself available to anticommu-
nist regimes that wanted help in fight-
ing off one band of Insurgents or an-
other. In the process, he became
friendly with a number of Latin Amer-
lea's political strongmen. They were
delighted to discover a North Ameri-
cano who felt as they did about the
need for stable, anticommunist. re-
gimes, especially their regimes, and
who had both the savvy and the guts
to help preserve them.

His first major paramilitary opera-
tion was in the Dominican Republic
during the 1965 revolt. He was, of
course, on the side of the government,
which was fending off allegedly Com-
munist insurgents; the United States
was on its side, too. WerBell wound up
in the midst of the fighting. He was
the second Dominican government
man to reach the Ozama River, scene
of the major battle.

Ellsworth Bunker, then U.S. ambas-
sador to the Organization of American
States, became highly exercised over
WerBell's activities and his hawkish
views on the conflict (WerBell opposed
a cessation of hostilities and establish-
ment of a coalition government).

Bunker considered trying to toss
WerBell out of the country, but noth-
ing came of it. WerBell's "independent
group"--CIA, Texas millionaires or
whatever saw to that.

WerBell was already active in the
anti-Castro movement, and he brought
to it a sense of dash and discipline that
the ragtag, bickering bunch of Cuban
exiles had seldom seen. Perhaps his
major anti-Castro exploit was a speed-
boat foray into Camarioca, on Cuba's
southern coast. The mission was to
drop a swimmer, apparently a spy, off-
shore, and to pick up the family of an
exile leader. The boat, flying the Con-
federate flag on the radio antenna,
foundered in high seas, and the raiding
party was captured. The Cubans, the
story goes, did not know what to make
of the brash WerBell, and he and his
pals wound up stealing a Castro boat
and spiriting some 10 anti-Castroites
out of the country before they them-
selves returned to the United States.

Vietnam Superhawk

IN THE LATE '60s, WerBell turned
his attention to Southeast Asia. He
is, of course, a superhawk on Viet-
nam, and would be happy if the U.S.
were also fighting communism in all
its neighboring countries. He was in
Thailand, "working closely with the
supreme command," for months, pro-
moting the sales of his weapons and
systems. "I showed them things like
surveillance equipment and night vi-
sion equipment, stuff that lets you sur-
prise the hell out of the bastards."
Did he do any fighting himself? Wer-
Bell chuckles. "I ain't supposed to be
shooting the stuff, just demonstrating
how to shoot it."

Three years ago, WerBell's weapons
business became promising enough for
him to go into it full time. He organ-
ized a firm called Sionics (for Studies
Armaments makes the case, too), com-
plete with suppressor and six maga-
zines.

Business Is Business

DOES WERBELL feel a twinge of
conscience about providing the
world with such deadly and efficient
weapons? No. "I see no reason to be
concerned," he says. "We're supplying
a certain product that is unfortunately
a part of the civilized world. As long as
people exist, there's going to be an
arms business. I don't see much differ-
ence between our supplying arms to
combatants and a surgical supply
house supplying gauze to bind up the
wounds inflicted."

There is his anticommunist argu-
ment, too. WerBell is fighting the
Communist menace: It is a fight that
must be won and weapons are needed
to win it.

Contrary to cynical opinion, Powder
Springs was not named in honor of
WerBell and his enterprise. WerBell,
in fact, stays as aloof from the local
community as possible. His house is so
well-stocked, it is practically self-suffi-
cient save for occasional trips to the
grocery and liquor stores. There has
been, from time to time, anti-WerBell
feeling in Powder Springs. WerBell de-
clares, "The hell with it. Who cares? I
tell 'em I'm prepared to purchase their
property if they don't like the area."

He does not suffer from loneliness,
however. There is a steady stream of
visitors and customers, foreigners as
well as Americans. A few weeks ago
WerBell's son-in-law, an Air Force lieu-
tenant colonel, flew in from Ohio,
mainly to see what was new around
the shop; he hadn't been by in several
months, he said, "and things change
awfully quickly around here." The day
I was there, the colonel and WerBell
swapped ideas on ridding the State De-
partment of no-win policy makers and
on bringing the enemy to his knees, or
its grave, in Vietnam.

WerBell recalls with relish one par-
ticular visitor. He came from the State
Department a few years back, and ac-
cording to WerBell, he said, "The func-
tions of the foreign policies of the
United States are the business of the
State Department in Washington, not
of Mitchell WerBell in Powder
Springs, Georgia." WerBell's reply?
"You can't print it. It was all-in Anglo-
Saxon words." But that was the old,
swashbuckling WerBell. The new, low-
profile WerBell says with a grin, "My
present policy is that I agree with that
theory completely. Period."

If actions to the contrary speak too
loudly, they, like WerBell's weapons,
can always be suppressed by the man
himself. Meanwhile, Mitch and his "In-
dependent group" march on.
