Note that the above volumes are numbered 1, 12, 3, and 6. I have asked Barbara if there is a volume 4 and 5. She said that Project Files are maintained in 4 parts: production, Developmental Plans, Support and Operations. The raid she thought I had the whole file but would check with the Mexican disk to make sure. Barbara returned call and said that the person on the Mexican disk is on 2 weeks vacation so she could not find an answer for my question.

Volume I / Production

See summary of Dispatch traffic for HMMA-2245-2. In addition to paragraph about archart it says, under heading "exploitation of LIENVOY Information" "MEXI 6453 reported a contact by an English-speaking man with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. This was forwarded to Headquarters for further dissemination"

See Dispatch Traffic Summary for details on The file # on most documents in this volume is 50-6-75/4. The file number on this Dispatch is 50-8-10, I have asked Barbara what this file is.

HMMA 22452 also cites other cables that reported Americans in contact with the Cuban embassy. Mexi 6591 reported a call from Herb Provost from Las Vegas claiming to be a student working with the Cubemb. The dispatch says: "Further dissemination was left to Headquarters." Meri 6615 reported contact between NYT writer Herbert Matthews and the Cubemb. The dispatch says: "No investigative action was taken by the Mexico Station."

AT HMMA-22678, 1/2/64 is the first monthly operational report for LIENVOY after the assassination. Under "exploitation dispatch says: "The most significant information provided by LIENVOY was record of contact by Lee

Oswald with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. Oswalds contact had been cabled to Headquarters on 8 October 1963 for investigation by ODENVY (MEXI-6453). Under the "liaison" heading the dispatch says the LIENVOY operation since it was necessary for Curtis to request his assistance in investigating a lead in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy, This has been reported in detail to Headquarters via other channels."

HMMA 22788 - 1/24/64 says "There is attached one of the Cuban Embassy traffic copy

covering the period from 16 January through 23 January 1964.

HMMA-22959 2/24/ omits the take for 2/11 to 2/21. HMMA 23019. 3/4/64 transmits the take for 2/22 to 3/2. My examination of the dispatch traffic between 10/16 and 11/26 shows that the Cubemb take was transmitted to HQ routinely weekly or bi-weekly basis also during that period. There are some "transcripts" in this file. They are yellow in Spanish. They cover the period 1/16/64 to 1/23/64. These are the only ones in the file.
