SUBJ: FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE /Fil-1961

At the request of Mr. Dave Phillips, C/WH/L/Propoganda, I spent the evening of January 6 with Court Wood, a student who has recently returned from a three week stay in Cuba under the sponsorship of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE.

Court and his father both have voiced very strong Pre-Castro sentiments and are extremely critical of our foreign policy.

I've been advised by Mr. Phillips to continue my relationship. Mr. Wood and I will keep your office informed of each subsequent visit.

Forwarded in part to you as a matter of information and to complete security file.
