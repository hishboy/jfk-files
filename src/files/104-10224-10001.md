IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ELIGIBLES

YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN ELIGIBLE NOTICE OF RATING. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

IT MEANS THAT: Your name has been placed on the list of persons who have passed this examination, in its proper relative standing. This list of eligibles, or register, is kept by the office whose name and address appears in the lower right-hand corner on the other side of this notice.

IT MEANS THAT: When your name is reached on the register, you will be considered for the type of jobs for which you have qualified. (in the geographical area) covered by the examination. (When a Federal agency requests the Commission to supply the names of eligibles, the names of the three eligibles at the top of the register are certified to the agency for consideration.) The agency appointing officer may choose any one of these three persons, so long as he complies with the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, as amended.

IT MEANS THAT: Your prospects for getting a job from this examination cannot be predicted. They depend upon how many vacancies may occur to be filled by eligibles, and on your relative standing on the register. Your name will be certified for consideration as it comes within reach and as requests for eligibles are received. (If you are not defected, your name will go back on the register in its proper relative standing, to be considered again when within reach until the register is terminated.)

IT MEANS THAT: YOU MUST INFORM THE OFFICE WHICH ISSUED THIS NOTICE OF RATING OF ANY CHANGES IN YOUR ADDRESS OR IN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH YOU WILL ACCEPT APPOINTMENT.

SEND ANY NEW INFORMATION CONCERNING YOUR ADDRESS OR AVAILABILITY TO THE OFFICE WHOSE NAME AND ADDRESS IS SHOWN IN THE LOWER RIGHT-HAND CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS NOTICE, AND REFER TO THE TITLE OF THE EXAMINATION AND THE RATING RECEIVED.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1.  Any offer of appointment or inquiry as to availability which you may receive from a Federal agency will show whether you are being considered for a limited temporary, a career-conditional, or a career appointment.

2.  If, when you are considered for appointment, you signify that you are not available or you fail to reply to a communication, your name will be removed from the register until you satisfactorily explain your reasons and specify the conditions under which you would be willing to accept any appointment. When you are unable to accept any appointment you should request that your name be suspended from the register until you are again able to. If you are still in use, changes in availability, or requests for restoration or transfer of eligibility, will be acted on without further notice to you.

3.  If you are now employed by the Federal Government and have received an eligible rating, show this notice to your personnel officer. He should be aware of your eligibility on this examination. THIS DOES NOT RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THE OFFICE MAINTAINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY INFORMED OF CHANGES AS MENTIONED ABOVE.

4.  A competitor who received an eligible rating may, under certain conditions, have his eligibility transferred from the register of one civil service office to a similar register in another civil service office.

A competitor who wishes to have his eligibility transferred should send his request to the office where his eligibility is maintained.

A determination will then be made, and the competitor will be notified, as to whether his eligibility can be transferred.

5.  A register established from an examination held in order to fill a specific type of position at a stated salary may also be used to fill vacancies in related positions or at a lower salary. When you accept a career-conditional or a career appointment, your name will be removed from all registers established as a result of this examination. Until your name is removed, your willingness to accept a lower salary will not affect your eligibility for positions at a higher salary.

If you are not appointed or the register is not officially terminated earlier, your eligibility from this examination will be in effect for a period of 18 months only unless you submit up-to-date information about your qualifications before that time by letter, Standard Form 57 or Form 57A; however, such information will not be accepted if you have had eligibility for less than 1 year.

The date of issue which appears on this "Notice of Rating" is that on which your period of eligibility began.

O - Outstanding Performance is so exceptional in relation to requirements of the work and in comparison to the performance of others doing similar
work as to warrant special recognition.

SPECIFIC DUTIES

List up to six of the most important specific duties performed during the rating period. Insert rating letter which best describes the
manner in which employee performs EACH specific duty. Consider ONLY effectiveness in performance of that duty. All employees

SECTION C - NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the past reporting period, Mr. Maksymiec's responsibilities were more pointedly directed towards the requirements of a laboratory technician as described in the position description and less towards his previous utilization as a photographer. A conference was held with him on 15 June to explain the need for this re-direction and a memo ATB U//70 dated 16 June was prepared and furnished to him detailing of performing these duties and was anxious to stop being thought of as a photographer and welcomed the opportunity to move into a more technically oriented activity. The specific duties outlined are listed in Section B of this report.

It was expected that there would be a learning period during which his proficiency would gradually increase in these new responsibilities. However, progress has not been as rapid as had been hoped due to what appears to be a lack of initiative on his part coupled with severe emotional outbursts against his immediate supervisor and other Center personnel. The latest of these occurred on 22 August in which he used abusive language in the presence of other Branch personnel including the Branch Chief against his Section Chief. This necessitated a written letter of reprimand and his transference to direct supervision by the Branch Chief, and as of 5 October 1970, to another Section within the Branch.

The ratings of M in Duties 1 and 2 of Section B reflect primarily the subject's reluctant participation in data collection and his lack of initiative in learning the operation of the microdensitometer. In duties 4, 5, 6, he has required a maximum amount of supervision which has resulted in senior personnel doing the work

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the rater's comments. We have been making every effort to aid Mr. Maksymiec in becoming an asset to RED as a laboratory technician. To date, there has been little noticeable progress; in fact, the temper outbursts mentioned above indicate a deteriorating condition. Unless this situation improves, it may be necessary to recommend termination action.

As I have stated in previous comments, it's unfortunate that he cannot find a position which takes advantage of his expertise in photography, since this would go a long way to resolving his problems.

To insure that he is given every opportunity to perform in his new section, written assignments and accomplishments will be submitted on a daily basis.

In line with previous reports, it is still felt that Mr. Maksymiec is essentially mis-assigned as he is an expert photographer and should be assigned in some area where his skill can be utilized to its fullest extent.

Mr. Maksymiec still has his primary duty as staff photographer. The finished product is consistently excellent.

He cooperates most willingly with other members of the staff in assisting them with the practical photographic aspects of their projects.

There have been a few minor personality conflicts on procedural matters related to job assignments between Mr. Maksymiec and both staff and non-staff personnel, which have been reported to the laboratory chief and the executive officer, TDS. It is believed that these are related to his strong desire to excel at his job. This problem has been discussed with Mr. Maksymiec and it is expected that he will avoid such occurrences in the future.
