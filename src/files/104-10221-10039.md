SUBJECT: LORENZ, Ilona Marita

SECRET

June 1976

As the result of an article on Subject in the 13 June 1976 New York Daily News LVCG was asked to do a file check to determine whether Subject was ever connected with the Agency. According to LVLOG Desk IP trace, C1/OA and Security Office check, LORENZ has never been employed by the Agency. Of interest, however, is the fact that her sister, Valerie LORENZ was granted a CSC on 14 July 1955, initiated by Finance Division, as a witting employee. At that time Valerie was an employee of the National Bank of Washington.

2. There are several references, sourced to the FBI and DCD. LORENZ is a self-admitted former girl friend of Fidel CASTRO. She claims that she met Fidel while on a trip to Cuba with her father, Captain of the North German Lloyd Line, in February 1959, became infatuated with Fidel and stayed in Cuba. She served as Fidel's mistress and came to the U.S. with Fidel's party in April 1959. She learned at that time that she was pregnant by him. Marita returned to Havana a short time thereafter and had a miscarriage. She claims that she was drugged and taken to a hospital where an abortion was performed. Because of Fidel's reaction to the pregnancy, she turned against him. LORENZ returned to the U.S. from Cuba on 9 December 1959.

Because of the bad abortion operation performed on LORENZ in Cuba in September 1959, LORENZ was operated on by a Dr. Hanniar on 20 January 1960 at the Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.

--- Page 9 ---

14-00000

It is said that LORENZ appeared on the Today's Show on 14 June 1976. She reportedly made the statement that she was associated with Frank STURGIS, and that she had placed some poison pills in her face cream for the purpose of assassinating Fidel. A 24 April 1961 FBI document states that on 8 January 1961 LORENZ, STURGIS, Alex RORKE were to meet that evening and attempt a unity meeting of anti-Castro Cubans. The unity meeting was sponsored by Luis CONTE Aguero, one of the leading anti Castro Cubans.

I have covered nothing to date concerning an assassination attempt (in this connection.)

FROM Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Frank STURGIS

REF CIR-316/01746-77

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Attention: Intelligence Division

According to a source of the Miami Field Office of the Domestic Collection Division, Subject disclosed to the source the following information concerning plans which allegedly reflect Subject's interest in Africa and Panama in conversations held on or around 5 June 1977.

Subject has discussed plans to establish a Cuban Government in exile on Angolan soil with the help of Holden ROBERTO, FNLA. Subject is prepared on receipt of agreement from Roberto to provide food, medical teams and other forms of assistance to the FNLA. Ostensibly, this would be a first step following recognition by Roberto of a Cuban Exile Government. This government would then attempt to raise troops and, among other things, capture as many Castro soldiers as possible for such an enterprise ostensibly would come from Cuban Communities in Brazil, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico, Venezuela and the United States. One aspect of the proposed unconventional war Also allegedly involved is planning to secure Angolan aid for Panamanians who oppose Torrijos.

Involved in unspecified ways in these plans are the following:

a. Leonel GOMEZ International Coordinator, Afro-Cuban Committee (appears to be inactive at present; formerly involved in the Cuban Exile Movement).

b. Dr. Alida REINOSO

c. (FNU) SOTOLONGO

STURGIS SAID THAT WHILE IN NEW YORK HE HAD STAYED THE WEEKEND (PRESUMABLY 21 AND 22 AUGUST) WITH MARITA LORENZ, WHO STURGIS SOMETIME AGO PUBLICLY CLAIMED TO HAVE HIRED TO POISON CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDEL CASTRO. LORENZ GAVE STURGIS A BOOK CONTAINING CRYPTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL THAT SHE SAID SHE HAD STOLEN FROM THE ALBANIAN MISSION IN NEW YORK. MORGAN WAS SHOWN MACHINE COPIES OF THREE OR FOUR PAGES OF THIS MATERIAL, WHICH CONSISTED OF FIVE DIGIT NUMERICAL GROUPS IN SERIES ACROSS THE PAGES.

STURGIS TOLD MORGAN THAT HE HAS DISTRIBUTED PAGES OF THE COOK IN VARIOUS PLACES IN MIAMI FOR SAFEKEEPING UNTIL HE CAN TURN ALL OF IT OVER TO SENATOR HOWARD BAKER. TO THIS END HE ALREADY HAD PLACED A CALL TO BAKER'S STAFF ON 23 AUGUST.
