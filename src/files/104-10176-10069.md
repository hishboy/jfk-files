OGC 66-2615

16 December 1966

The Honorable J. Walter Yeagley

Assistant Attorney General

Internal Security Division

Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Walt:

After you informed me on 29 November 1966 of the possible indictment by the U. S. Attorney in Florida of Rolando Masferrer and others concerned in the plan to launch an expedition from Florida against President Duvalier of Haiti, I asked for a report on our knowledge of, or involvement in, this activity.

As you know, we have installations in the Miami area which utilize a variety of sensitive covers. The Chief of Station coordinates his activities closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Bureau of Customs of the Department of the Treasury and disseminates to these offices in the area pertinent intelligence information.

Our Station was well informed on the plans of Masferrer and his cohorts and disseminated this information in the normal manner. Part of this reporting included information that Masferrer and some of his associates repeatedly asserted that their plotting had been approved by the U. S. Government. On some occasions they stated this approval came from this Agency, and other times they intimated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had approved their actions. These claims were apparently used to persuade various persons, primarily Cuban exiles, some of whom formerly had contact with the Agency, to join the plot. It appears logical to assume that Masferrer would continue to claim that he had received what he interpreted to be U. S. Government approval of the scheme to overthrow President Duvalier, and if he has

SECRET

14-00000

nothing more positive he can take the approach that he considered the U. S. Government tacitly approved his plot since it obviously knew about it and did not take any action against him.

For the record, it can be flatly stated that neither by statement nor by implication has the Central Intelligence Agency indicated to anyone that it approved or was supporting the plot. On the contrary, those who queried people they knew were connected with our Agency concerning possible participation in the plot were told that it had no U. S. Government backing whatsoever. Some of the plotters attempted to contact this Agency through various intermediaries, and the intermediaries were told that the Agency wished to have nothing to do with the undertaking and that any information concerning violations of U. S. laws should be passed to law enforcement agencies, particularly the Bureau of Customs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Technically, therefore, the Agency has stayed clear of the plotters, and we would be in a position to state that we had no connection with the plot and had given it no encouragement or backing of any sort.

As a practical matter, however, if prosecution were pursued, Masferrer, and perhaps other defendants, would probably claim that they had CIA backing and some might even believe it to be true. This might well lead one or more defendants to seek a subpoena duces tecum for an Agency witness and the Agency documentation on the subject. As noted above, the witness can testify to the fact that the Agency had in no way participated or encouraged the activity. If it proved impossible to quash the requirement for production of documents, however, we would be faced with a situation where we would almost certainly have to claim the documents were privileged on the grounds of security. Aside from the sensitivity of the reports and their possible compromise of sources, we would have the problem of identification of our personnel under cover and of protecting the sensitive cover arrangements.

The same is true to a lesser extent of action against Masferrer in connection with violations of his parole. In view of the flagrant and numerous violations which were actually known to and reported by Government agencies without any punitive action resulting, it would appear that he could make a plausible claim that the Government had at least winked at, if

not condoned, his activities. I would seem preferable to have him immediately put under a more stringent parole, perhaps with an accompanying requirement of bond. In the event he violated this new status, prompt action could be taken on those circumstances alone.

Sincerely,

ABSTRACT

1. FOLLOWING RECEIVED FROM GENERAL COUNSEL IN RESPONSE REF.

2. REF REPORT IS EXCELLENT AND VERY USEFUL IN CONNECTION OGC DISCUSSIONS WITH DEPT OF JUSTICE.

3. TECHNICALLY, ON FACTS STATED, THERE DOES NOT APPEAR BE ANY REASON WHY WOZACT SHOULD OPPOSE INDICTMENT AND TRIAL OF MASFERRER. THIS BASED ON GROUND THAT WE COULD REFUTE ANY CLAIMS MASFERRER AND HIS COHORTS MADE OF WOFACT SUPPORT. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DOES NOT RECOGNIZE TYPE OF SITUATION WOFACT LIKELY GET INTO IF INDICTMENT IS BROUGHT. WOFACT LEARNED THROUGH EXPERIENCE THAT DEFENSE COUNSEL ONLY TOO EAGER CLAIM WOFACT PARTICIPATION AND APPROVAL AS PART OF DEFENSE, AND IT NOT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO LAY ENOUGH BASIS FOR COURT TO ISSUE A SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM REQUIRING PRESENCE OF A WOFACT

[This report was developed by a Navy representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

During the night of 22 Nov 66 a decision was reached to call off the proposed invasion of Haiti by the group sponsored by Rolando Masferrer. The invasion is off indefinitely.

Father Jean Baptiste Georges and Colonel Rene Leon have been arguing with Masferrer which has caused confusion and disorganization in the movement.

Many Cubans scheduled to participate have pulled out and military chief Napoleon Villaboise (sic), a Cuban national and alleged military expert, has resigned because of dissension in the group.

It is believed that US Government agencies have infiltrated the movement and the leaders fear that all weapons and equipment would be confiscated if plans for the invasion proceeded.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION between

Andrew St. George -- CBS photographer.

William G. Bowdler.

SUBJECT: Invasion of Haiti

Andrew St. George called me from Miami.

He said that he and the CBS film crew, headed by a Mr. McMullin (phonetic), were back in Miami to cover the departure this weekend of the expedition which Rolando Masferrer was organizing to invade Haiti. St. George claimed that Masferrer had recruited 300 men and arranged for the use of one B-19, two C-46s and a large boat. He said that all the preparations were so much in the open that it was evident that Masferrer and his Haitian colleagues had received the "green light". Recent events in Haiti, plus Masferrer's activities, were attracting a lot of newsmen to Miami.

I told St. George that he was mistaken about the "green light". We will not tolerate violation of our neutrality laws. Our enforcement Agencies, whose duty it is to enforce these laws, will not permit what he described taking place. I wanted him and those with whom he was dealing to be clear on this point. He said he would inform Mr. McMullin.

US national with wide travel experience in Latin America. He speaks some Spanish, and has many social and business contacts in the Dominican Republic.

[This report was developed by a Navy representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

On 28 Oct 66 I spoke with Rolando Masferrer Rojas, a Cuban exile, and he told me that he has organized a military force of approximately 250 men to invade Haiti. The invasion force consists of Cuban and Haitian exiles residing in the US, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. The invasion will probably be launched from the Dominican Republic sometime between 5 and 13 November and the target is Port-au-Prince. The invasion force will strike in the early hours of the morning selected. It is well armed, and will have air cover; the presidential palace will be bombed.

Masferrer stated that Eugene L. Maximilien, Haitian Consul in Miami, Florida, is aware of the invasion, but he has no knowledge of the invasion date.

Maximilien is presently in Haiti informing President Duvalier that the invasion can be prevented by paying off $200,000 to Masferrer. Maximilien will return to the US on 3 November and he has agreed with Masferrer that if Duvalier agrees to the pay-off, Maximilien will receive $50,000 and Masferrer $150,000.

Masferrer told me that the invasion will take place in any event and the $150,000, if received, would be used to further support the invasion.

Masferrer stated that he met within the past 10 days with several dissident Haitian army officers and he had received their support. The Haitian army officers told Masferrer that they would revolt as soon as informed that the invasion had commenced. They do not know that the target will be Port-au-Prince; they believe that it will be in the Cap Haitien area.

Masferrer stated that he was confident that the invasion will succeed, and if successful, Father Jean Baptiste Georges would be appointed provisional president. Masferrer stated that Colonel Rene Leon, Haitian exile, will participate in the invasion.

SOURCE: THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

Former Latin American diplomat who maintains relations with officials of Latin American countries. Source is a trained reporter and his information has been reliable in the past. He obtained this information from Aurea Esther Poggio.

1. On 21 September 1967 in Miami, Florida, Aurea Esther Poggio, a Cuban émigré who is a secretary to Rolando Masferrer Rojas, said that plans had been made to assassinate persons linked with revolutionary movements in Miami opposing President Francois Duvalier of Haiti. Poggio said that the first such attempt was against Julio Aton Constanzo Palau on 17 September 1967.

2. Poggio said that Masferrer's group was investigating the matter in an effort to find out who was carrying out the assassination plans for Duvalier.

Field Comment: Constanzo, Cuban émigré, was among those indicted with Masferrer, former Cuban senator, and Father Jean Baptiste Georges, Haitian émigré, by a federal grand jury in Miami in February 1967 on charges of conspiring to launch an invasion of Haiti from the Florida Keys. No coverage of an attempt to kill Constanzo has been noted in the local press.

Headquarters Comment: According to TDCS-314/08728-67, about mid-1967 Duvalier instructed Andre Elie, Haitian Consul in New York, to keep close surveillance on Haitian exiles and to report all plans for invasions of Haiti.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Liaison Meeting with FBI New York Agent Frank O'Brien

1. At 1500 hours on 13 September, Ken Millian and I met with FBI Cuban specialist Frank O'Brien at a cafe/coffee shop at 72nd St. and 3rd Ave., two blocks away from the Bureau's New York headquarters. I had arranged the meeting by telephone from Washington and advised O'Brien that I wanted to review and coordinate a number of items with him. I also informed him that I would be accompanied by Millian, a colleague interested in the Cuban UN Mission.

2. The meeting opened at an easy pace with an uninhibited review of happenings of mutual interest: O'Brien noted that in his view the Cubans at the Mission had been relatively inactive and had not recently been involved in subversive activities of any magnitude. He reviewed FBI coverage of as yet not fully explained purchasing activity by Mission personnel which included procurement from various New York area military surplus outlets of ponchos, leggings, and other similar equipment. He implied that in the process of covering the activities, the Bureau had acquired a substantial amount of surplus equipment itself but he didn't provide details and we didn't pursue the matter.

3. He noted that blanket Bureau coverage of the activities of Rolando Masferrer was continuing and that he occasionally talked with Masferrer by telephone or in person. He indicated that the Bureau was intimately aware of efforts on the part of Masferrer and other Cubans both in New York and Florida to procure arms in the U.S. and position them in the Dominican Republic. He reported that an attempt to move a shipment of such arms from the Florida Keys to the D.R. currently was underway and that the U.S. Customs Service was alerted to move in at the appropriate time to confiscate the material. (Although acknowledging Masferrer's gangster background, O'Brien complemented him on his intelligence and efficiency and indicated that Masferrer was one of the ablest Cuban refugees he had met.)

O'Brien also surfaced his current contact with former Rebel Army Captain Raimundo F. Antonio de la Torre Ugarte, 81-11 Pettit Ave., Elmhurst, Long Island, tel. NR 2-5487.

Ugarte, 81-11 Pettit Ave., Elmhurst, Long Island, tel. NR 2-5487.

De la Torre apparently is involved with Cuban refugees in the U.S. who are attempting to re-establish the 26th of July Movement here in the United States minus the Communist implications contributed by Fidel. O'Brien apparently is impressed with De la Torre's sincerity and ability and believes that De la Torre should be of interest to us. De la Torre has until recently stayed away from exile activities and according to O'Brien is pushing the revitalized 26th of July idea by personal contact rather than make any splash. According to O'Brien De la Torre is now operating a successful painting business and at one time held a good position with Union Carbide International. In conversations with O'Brien De la Torre has been critical of CIA. When queried O'Brien indicated that De la Torre's only real gripe was the Bay of Pigs. (C/O note: We should look into De la Torre to see if he could be used in any revitalized effort abroad to establish lines of access to non-Communist 26th of Julyers still in Cuba - Carlos Franqui etc.) We indicated that we would evaluate information available to us and discuss De la Torre with him again in the future.

5. Note: O'Brien has been working the Cuban target in New York for over ten years and is impressively conversant with the subject. It is, therefore, sometimes difficult to stay with him when he covers various complicated subjects with abbreviated statements, e. g., during subject meeting, he alluded to one Miguel Morales, the former husband of Nellie Barletta, daughter of Batista's ambassador to Argentina Amleto Barletta. He apparently feels there may be mileage in Morales. We will, therefore, review Morales, Barletta, et al, and resurface the subject with him when time permits.

6. The two principal action items on my agenda were the coordination of my planned luncheon meeting with photo-journalist Lee J. Lockwood (201-78771), and discussion of NEKNIFE, who allegedly was interviewed by the Bureau in New York several years ago. O'Brien advised me that he had reviewed their Lockwood file and talked with the Bureau agent responsible for the Lockwood "case". He stated that he had not uncovered any derogatory information on Lockwood and saw no reason to prevent my meeting with him. I told him I would advise him of my meeting arrangements with Lockwood when they were firm and that I would brief him after the meeting was over. (It is of interest to note that during my briefing of O'Brien on the morning of the 16th, the day following my luncheon with Lockwood, O'Brien noted that some of his superiors in Washington thought Lockwood was an opposition (sic) "spy". When I asked if there was anything to support this theory, O'Brien said absolutely not, it was pure speculation.)

7. O'Brien checked the Bureau's New York indices on NEKNIFE but without success. If he was in fact interviewed by the FBI in New York there apparently was no record of it. I told him that NEKNIFE was expected in New York City in late September to visit his daughter and son-in-law and that we probably would attempt a meeting with him at the time. He had no objection.

8. Specific items of business concluded, we moved into a general and historical discussion of the Cuban Mission to the UN, which was the main purpose of Millian's attendance at the meeting. Recent changes in Mission personnel, including the assignment of Ricardo Alarcón Quesada (201-347590) as Ambassador, were discussed and itineraries of Cubans arriving for the General Assembly were noted. Early in the conversation, O'Brien surfaced his long term contact with Cuban UN Advisor and Alternate Representative Antonio de Souza Carvajal (201-354048), a friend of Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa, who has served the Cubans in New York for the past ten years or more and has been with the Cuban Foreign Service for 40 years. The Souza subject was not new to me, since O'Brien had brought it up in conversations I had with him earlier this year. I did not choose to pursue the subject with him at that time, however, without first reviewing all implications of the case with Agency officials in Washington. O'Brien indicated no interest in Miguel Juan Alfonso Martínez (201-354041), Counselor at the Mission, whom we suspected they might be in contact with.

9. O'Brien's eagerness to discuss the Souza matter seems to imply that he is deeply interested in it and may suggest that he is not satisfied with results thus far obtained. At one point he indicated that his headquarters was not at all happy with the take from Souza. He reviewed the history of the contact with complete candor beginning with his initial contacts with Souza in the mid/late 1950'
