ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1. Project KDFACTOR was amended 10 December 1971 for $4,260 for FY 1971 to cover the termination bonuses for KDFACTOR-1 and KDFACTOR-7. The Project amendment also provides funds of $19,000 for FY 1972 and $20,000 for FY 1973.

2. One of the provisos of the Project amendment is that the Station furnish Headquarters an updated security review of this operation with particular attention to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their families. The Station should also address itself to the contingency that the present sites or personnel will be blown and investigate alternate means of continuing the KDFACTOR coverage. Please forward the security review to arrive at Headquarters no later than 15 March 1972.

SUBJECT Turnover of LIEMPTY Project

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
ACTION REQUIRED: None. For your information.
REFERENCE: HMMA-39,679, 28 October 1970

1. Primary responsibility for the operational and administrative handling of the LIEMPTY Project was transferred, effective 1 December 1970, within the Station from the REDTOP to the Operational Support Section. This transfer was made as part of our effort to consolidate basic support functions in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP Section of activities which do not contribute directly to the pursuit of priority recruitment targets. However, the REDTOP Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA photo surveillance points. It will also be the main provider of guidance and requests for special LILYRIC/LICALLA coverage.

2. The previous REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H. FERNALD) introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T. BAGAUS, to LIEMPTY-9, -13, and -14 in early December. LIMOUSINE, owner of the LILYRIC property, will continue to be handled by Timothy M. ARCHBOLD of the REDTOP Section.

LILYRIC personnel have done such good work that station now has better coverage than ever and at less cost.

1. Headquarters' confusion regarding the various LIEMPTY properties is understandable, although each change in location was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved. The confusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations in 1966 without changing cryptonyms. Up to this point, LIMITED had been in a building owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE fronting for WOFIRM). LILYRIC had been renting an apartment in a building in which WOFIRM had no financial interest. In 1965, however, LIMOUSINE bought the property containing the building in which LIMITED had been located, razed the building, and built a new building in which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however, was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial payment on the loan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that he could buy the building). For various operational reasons it was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building, instead of the LIMITED crew. LIMITED was therefore moved into the building which LILYRIC had occupied. At this point, of course, new cryptonyms should probably have been assigned in order to avoid the confusion which has evidently developed. (This was not, however, simply a switch of personnel each base house retained its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were not changed). As far as LICALLA is concerned, the confusion

probably stems from the fact that, while it's location has not changed, it is located within the LIMUST building, which is owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE acting as "front") and which is administered within the LIMESA project. As stated, however, all of this has been carefully documented for Headquarters. The LIMOUSINE purchase of the old LIMITED building generated considerable correspondence (see particularly EX 2159 and DIR 77745 of January 1965). HEMMA-28322 and HMMA-39403 spelled out the reasons tor switching LILYRIC and LIMITED, and the completion of the move was reported in HMELY-30687. Finally, sketches and plans of the LILYRIC and LIMITED houses in their new locations were forwarded with HMMA-31303, dated 7 February 1967. As far as LICALLA is concerned, its location and status was never open to question, and its location in the LIMUST complex is regularly mentioned in LIMESA progress renewal requests. The Station understands that a memo describing the locations of the various base houses was attached to the most recent LIMESA project renewal request when it was submitted to the staffs by WH/1.

2. Personnel within the base houses is also well-documented (most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent in each house), and the personnel have never been switched from house to house. Perhaps the best rundown of these personnel is Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with HMMA-31164 24 January 1967.

3. Station Real Property reports are also, with one exception (MEXI-41), up-to-date and they reflect current conditions. MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA. Nevertheless, the Station asked for $1800 for rent and utilities for the following reasons: first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable expense no matter who owns the apartment. Secondly, the rent, even though returned to the Station because WOFIRM owns the building, must physically be paid by the occupant of LICALLA. He, in turn, is reimbursed by the Station via GERENDE. LIMOUSINE eventually returns the money, at which time it is credited to expense. This could, of course, be handled differently, but the Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner, largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a semi-annual basis. The reimbursement, therefore, often comes, many months after the payment.

4. The Station neglected to cancel MEXI-41, which should be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the move in 1966. LILYRIC is now MEXI-132, and is in the building Owned by LIMOUSINE. Rent payments are, as originally intended; being used to help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as instructed in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, the Station is crediting this money to miscellaneous receipts. There can be, therefore, no question of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in the LIEMPTY project. LILYRIC rent is, and has been since the apartment was occupied in October 1966, 3,000 pesos per month, which amounts to $2,880 per year ($3,200 has been requested in order to include utilities). Headquarters is correct in stating that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building was 2,300 pesos per month. Station files indicate that the reason for the increase (and this apparently was not reported to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major part of LIMOUSINE's loan had determined that 3,000 pesos was a fair price for the apartment. The Station had, of course, no choice but to go along with this.

5. The Station has no record of MEXI-02, but it is likely that this is the old LIMITED apartment, which was indeed purchased by WOFIRM (via LIMOUSINE) in 1955. But since that building was later purchased and razed by LIMOUSINE, the old LIMITED apartment ceased to exist. The LIMITED base house was subsequently transferred to the building which had previously housed LILYRIC (but not to the same apartment), and LIMITED is

SECRST
HMMA-33814

now carried, in its current location, as MEXI-113. As was the case with old LILYRIC, the rent money is not returned to the Station FOFIRM has no financial interest in the building. Thus it is evident that the LIEMPTY project renewal, which used to say LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned to Station by LIMOUSINN and credited to Station miscellaneous receipts" should now carry the footnote "LICALLA rent is returned to the Station and credited to expense; LILYRIC rent is, and will be through September 1969, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINE and credited to miscellaneous receipts as partial payment on Station loan to LIMOUSINE."

6. Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom is the room where the films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC, LIMITED, and LIENTRÁP are developed, printed, and (on request) enlarged by LIEMPTY-4. This darkroom is located in GERENDS's apartment, and he is paid 1,000 pesos per month for maintenance of the darkroom in recognition of the fact that one room in his living quarters has been turned into a darkroom, and his electric and water bills are substantially higher than they would normally be without a darkroom on the premises. GERENDE 18 building a house which he expects to occupy in February 1968. His plans for the house specifically include a LIEMPTY darkroom, and he will continue to be paid 1,000 pesos per month for this. To cover this payment in the new house, MEXI-137 has been written and will be forwarded to Headquarters shortly.

7. In answer to paragraph 5 of reference, it is hoped that the following summary will end the confusion:
a. LICALLA
(1) MEXI-03
(2) Address under separate cover (Identity-1). 15
(3) LICALLA has been in operation at its present location since 1956, originally as a rented property. In September 1957 the building in which LICALLA is located (which consists of four units, collectively known as LIMUST) was purchased by the Station, with LIMOUSINE acting as a front.
(4) Actual cost is nothing, since property is owned by WOFIRM. The original purchase price for the four units was $40,000.00 with an additional $20,000.00 spent on renovation. Rent is paid for cover purposes at the annual rate of $1,248.00
(5) Cost of utilities is estimated at $552.00 annually.
(6) Since June 1957, LIEMPTY-9 (originally LIPSTICK-39) has operated the LICALLA base house. No other LIEMPTY agents are associated with LICALLA.

b. LIMITED
(1) MEXI-113
(2) Address under separate cover (Identity 2)
(3) LIMITED has been in its current location since December 1964, and it is a rented property. at its previous location, the LINITED base had been in operation from 1953 until September 1964.
(4) Annual rent is $1,440.00
(5) Annual cost of utilities is estimated at $560.00.
(6) LIEMPTY-6 (originally LIPSTICK-14) has operated the LIMITED base house (in both locations) since 1955. No other LIEMPTY agents are associated with LIMITED.

C. LILYRIC

SECRET
HMMA-23814

(1) MEXI-132
(2) Address under separate cover (Identity 3)
(3) LILYRIC has been in its present location since October 1966, when the new building was completed and ready for occupancy. it is a rented property, although for three years beginning 1 October 1966 the rent is to be turned to the Stations partial payment on a loan to LIMOUSINE. This loan was made to permit LIMOUSINE to purchase the property and construct the building in which LILYRIC is located. This property had previously belonged to WOFIRM and had contained the building in which LIMITED had been located. LILYRIC was previously (November 1956 to September 1966) located in a rented property (the same building, but not the same apartment, in which LIMITED is now located).
(4) Annual rent is $2,880.00.
(5) Estimated annual cost of utilities is $320.00.
(6) LIEMPTY-13 (originally LIJERSEY-2) has operated the LILYRIC base house (in both locations) since LILYRIC was established in 1956. He is supported by his wife (LIEMPTY-14), and his son (LIEMPTY-27). Another son, LIEMPTY-20, has also worked in LILTRIC. (Because LIEMPTY-13 has a full-time job, LIEMPTY-14 does most of the photographic work, assisted by LIEMPTY-27. LIEMPTY-13 does some of this work, and makes all meetings with GERENDE.)

d. LIEMPTY photo lab.
(1) MEXI-137
(2) Address (as of February 1968) under separate cover (Identity 4).
(3) Actually, no property as such is involved here. The Chief of Station authorized payment to GERENDE for the use of a room in his quarters as a darkroom in 1961, after GERENDE was moved out of a base house in which he lived (rent-free) and maintained the dark room.
(4) and (5) Annual cost is $960.00, including utilities.
(6) The occupant is GERENDE, although the photo processing is normally done by LIEMPTY-4.

8. It is hoped that the above will shed some light on the problem; the Station will be glad to answer any further questions Headquarters may have.
