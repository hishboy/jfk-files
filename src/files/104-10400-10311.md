WITH TARGETS AND USE OF LIAISON - STATION BUDGET, ETC., ACTUAL
EXAMPLES WERE USED WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE POINT.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE PDWHIZ CASE WAS USED TO SHOW HOW THE STATION
FOCUSES ON AN INDIVIDUAL, PRIMARY TARGET. IT WAS A LIVELY
SESSION, WITH CONGRESSMAN ROBINSON AND SNODGRASS! THE "LIVE
WIRES" OF THE GROUP. QUESTIONS WERE OF A ROUTINE NATURE
PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCIDENTAL OPS DETAILS. FOR EXAMPLE,
CONGRESSMAN ROBINSON NOTED THAT HE FELT IT RATHER EASY TO IDENTIFY
THE SENIOR AGENCY OFFICERS OF A MISSION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY
HAPPEN TO BE INTERFACED ADMINISTRATIVELY WITHIN AN EMBASSY
COS RESPONSE WAS THAT SUCH IS OFTEN TRUE, BUT THAT STATIONS AND
HQS MANAGEMENT ARE FOCUSING ON THAT SPECIFIC PROBLEM, AND THAT THE
WELCH INCIDENT HAS CERTAINLY ACCELERATED OUR EFFORTS IN THAT
REGARD.

SPENT IN DISCUSSING STATION OPS. GEORGE CARY CERTIFIED
THAT THE GROUP WAS "WITTING" AND A FEW QUESTIONS AND

IMPACTED FAVORABLY ON THE DELEGATION AND THAT THEY WERE SURPRISED
AND PLEASED TO GET SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS.
HE ADDED THAT WHAT OFTEN GAVE HIM TROUBLE WAS STATEMENTS BY
AGENCY OFFICERS THAT THEY HAD BEEN PURSUING SOVIET OFFICIALS FOR
TEN YEARS OR MORE AND HAD NOT YET RECRUITED ONE. HE ALLUDED TO
THIS AS THE BUREAUCRAT'S DREAM, BEING PERPETUALLY PAID FOR SEEKING
THE HOLY GRAIL WITHOUT EVER FINDING IT. COS POINTED OUT TO MR.
SNODGRASS THAT SOVIETS WERE BEING RECRUITED AND THAT THE WORK
OF UNE STATION, WHICH MIGHT NOT RESULT IN RECRUITMENT WOULD BE

RECRUITMENT APPROACH. IN COST EFFECTIVENESS TERMS, ALSO POINTED
OUT THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF A SINGLE SOVIET COULD AND DOES RESULT
IN A MORE ACCURATE APPRAISAL OF THE SOVIET THREAT AND THUS A MORE
REALISTIC ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO MEET IT. MR. SNODGRASS ADMITTED
THAT THIS WAS SO BUT ADDED HIS OPINION THAT MORE RATHER THAN LESS
CONGRESSIONAL CONTACT WITH CIA FIELD PERSONNEL AS IN JAKARTA
WOULD BE A PLUS FOR THE AGENCY AND GIVE THE CONGRESS A BETTER
FEEL FOR OUR ENDEAVORS AND PROBLEMS.
3. MR. CARY ALSO SAID THAT ON THE BASIS OF HIS TALKS WITH
MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIEFING HAD GONE
