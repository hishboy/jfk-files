MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Guy Vitale
THROUGH : Head of D Career Service
SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

20 October 1965

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees".

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials or your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 6E-1319 Head-
quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of
the date of this memorandum.
