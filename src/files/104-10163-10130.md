REAM

1. DUSKIRT-2 HAS ASKED IF WE COULD OBTAIN FOR HIM THE CURRENT
ADDRESS OF MANUEL ARTIME. D-2 WAS FRIEND AND COLLABORATOR OF
ARTIME FROM 1959 UNTIL THEY LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER IN 1968.

WHEN D-2 FIRST CAME TO PERU HE CARRIED LETTER SIGNED BY ARTIME
IDENTIFYING HIM AS ARTIME PERSONAL REP IN PERU.

2. D-2 WANTS TO CONTACT ARTIME TO ASK HIS HELP IN OBTAINING
NICARAGUAN PASSPORT. HE CLAIMS ARTIME RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMOZA
IS SUCH THAT ARTIME COULD OBTAIN FOR D-2 NICARAGUAN PASSPORT AND
PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF HONORARY CONSUL DESIGNATION. D-2 WILL WRITE
LETTER TO ARTIME EXPLAINING HIS SITUATION AND WILL ASK STATION
TO POUCH LETTER TO MIAMI FOR MAILING THERE EITHER DIRECTLY TO
ARTIME OR TO D-2 SISTER FOR HER TO DELIVER PERSONALLY TO ARTIME.

3. AS ABOVE INDICATES, D-2 REMAINS PREOCCUPIED WITH FACT HE
DOES NOT POSSESS VALID PASSPORT. HE HAS TRIED NUMEROUS SCHEMES
TO OBTAIN SAME WITHOUT SUCCESS. HE STRONGLY FEELS HE MUST HAVE
DOCUMENTATION TO LEAVE PERU IF NECESSARY. HE WORRIES ABOUT
POSSIBILITY OF ONE DAY BEING ARRESTED, PERHAPS AS RESULT HIS
BKHERALD ACTIVITY, AND DEPORTED TO CUBA BY LEFTIST PERUVIAN
GOVT. HE ADMITS THAT HIS EXPERIENCES IN CUBA AFTER CASTRO'S
TAKEOVER COLOR HIS PERCEPTION OF THE DANGER IN HIS CURRENT
SITUATION BUT HE IS NOT WILLING TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO SIMILAR
DEVELOPMENT IN PERU. EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL OF COURSE
NOT REASSURE HIM RE THE SITUATION HERE.

4. OTHER THAN ARTIME GAMBIT, ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR
OBTAINING PASSPORT WHICH REMAIN OPEN TO D-2 ARE PERUVIAN CITIZEN-
SHIP OR GOING TO CUBAN EMBASSY AND ASKING THAT THEY RENEW HIS
EXPIRED CUBAN PASSPORT. HE REJECTS IDEA PERUVIAN CITIZENSHIP,
CLAIMING HE STILL PLANS EVENTUALLY RETURN TO LIVE IN UNITED STATES
BUT ALSO BECAUSE HIS FEARS ABOUT ULTIMATE DESTINATION PERUVIAN
REVOLUTION AND POSSIBILITY MARXIST DICTATORSHIP COMING TO POWER
HERE. HE AND STATION ARE NATURALLY RELUCTANT HAVE HIM APPROACH
THERE PROBABLY THICK FILE ON HIM IN HAVANA AND WE WOULD
NOT WISH CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS PRESENCE HERE. HOWEVER THIS
OPTION MUST BE EXAMINED AND THEREFORE WOULD BE HELPFUL IF HQS
COULD PROVIDE INFO ON EXPERIENCE OTHERS SUCH AS D-2, FORMERLY
ACTIVE CASTRO OPPONENTS NOW IN EXILE IN COUNTRIES WHICH MAINTAIN

AS ADDRESSEES AWARE, WHEN AMWORLD WAS CLOSED
OUT TWO YEARS AGO, AMBIDDY-1 WAS AUTHORIZED TO HOLD
ROUGH EQUIVALENT OF WEAPONS TO ARM ONE RIFLE COMPANY.
WEAPONS STORED AT THE MONKEY POINT OPS BASE, AT EL BLUFF

POINT BASE WAS CLOSED AND WEAPONS THERE MOVED TO EL BLUFF.

4. AMBIDDY-1 CONTACTED JAMES D. ZABOTH 4 MARCH, SAID
HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN NICARAGUA, DID
NOT WANT TO ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG HANDS, NOR
TO GIVE THEM TO NIC GOVT. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS
LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP
ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS
AND TYPES REMAINING. AMBIDDY-1 ASKED IF WOFACT WISHED TO
RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN
OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-1 AND AMJAVA-4, WHO IN MANAGUA ON
OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED BLUFF ISLAND 6 MARCH TO CHECK
SITUATION. IF HQS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE
METHOD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-123 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD
LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM
OUT NEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS,
AMBIDDY-1 COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGEMENTS TO DUMP
WEAPONS AT SEA.

5. DESPITE AMBIDDY-1 DESIRE NOT INFORM SOMOZA ABOUT
ARMS CACHE, COS FEELS THAT SOMOZA SHOULD BE INFORMED IF

HQS DECISION IS THAT ARMS SHOULD BE RECOVERED. SOMOZA
COULD BE TOLD THAT "SOME EQUIPMENT" LEFT BEHIND BY AMWORLD
GROUP NOW STORED AT BLUFF AND LNHARP WISHES RECOVER. BELIEVE
HE WOULD AGREE TO AIRCRAFT PICKUP AS PROPOSED ABOVE. IN
STATION OPINION BLACK RECOVERY WITHOUT SOMOZA KNOWLEDGE
TOO RISKY. STATION ALSO FEELS THESE WEAPONS SHOULD BE
REMOVED FROM CENTRAL AMERICA LEST THEY FALL INTO WRONG HANDS.

1. DURING RECENT KD ALCOHOL-1 (K-1) MEETING WITH SLOTH-21,
LATTER PUSHED HIM HARD RE VARIOUS CUBAN EXILE TASKS. SLOTH-21
TOLD HIM THAT "HAVANA" HAD COMMENDED HIS REPORTING TO DATE ON
EXILES (ESSENTIALLY OVERT BIO AND BACKGROUND INFO AND CONTRIVED
SPECULATION BY K-1 CONCERNING EXILE INTENTIONS). FOLLOWING ITEMS
ON EXILES REPORTED TO STATION BY K-1 SEEM OF PARTICULAR INTEREST:

A. DURING DECEMBER VISIT MIAMI, K-1 MET WITH MANUEL
FRANCIS ARTIME BUESA (201-0267437). ARTIME ASKED K-1 LOOK
OUT FOR MEAT EXPORT/IMPORT OPPORTUNITIES IN MEXICO. ARTIME ALSO
TOLD K-1 THAT FROM TIME TO TIME HE MIGHT SEND K-1 (FROM A MIAMI
P.O. BOX) LETTERS TO BE SMUGGLED INTO CUBA VIA ANY OF K-1'S FRIENDS
TRAVELING THERE FROM MEXICO. K-1 TOLD THIS TO SLOTH-21 WHO BECAME
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE MATTER. SLOTH-21 INSTRUCTED K-1 TO ALERT
HIM IF ANY LETTERS ARRIVE (NONE HAVE SO FAR). ACCORDING TO
SLOTH-21, LETTERS OF THIS SORT ARE MONITORED BY CUBAN SECURITY

OFFICIALS WHO THEN SURVEIL THE RECIPIENTS. THIS MAY PROVIDE
OPPORTUNITY FOR VWTOGA-TYPE OP INTENDED BURN IMPORTANT CUBAN
OFFICIAL. RISK TO K-1 WOULD BE MINIMAL SINCE HE WOULD MERELY
BE INTERMEDIARY FOR LETTER OSTENSIBLY COMING FROM ARTIME OR SOME
OTHER EXILE LEADER.

B. SLOTH-21 TOLD K-1 DEVELOP ALL POSSIBLE BACKGROUND
INFO ON JOSE IGNACIO RASCO BERMUDEZ (201-0274330), CUBAN
EXILE RESIDING IN MIAMI. WHILE SLOTH-21 DID NOT REVEAL REASON
FOR CUBAN INTEREST IN RASCO, BASED ON K-1'S KNOWLEDGE OF RASCO
AND SLOTH-21'S MANNER, K-1 BELIEVES THAT RASCO ATTEMPTING DIALOGUE
WITH CUBAN GOVERNMENT. K-1 KNOWS RASCO ONLY SLIGHTLY, BUT KNOWS
HIS BROTHER, RAMON, WELL. K-1 AND RAMON RASCO WERE ASSOCIATED
WITH A CREDIT UNION IN MIAMI SOME YEARS AGO. K-1 MET RAMON BY
CHANCE WHILE IN MIAMI IN DECEMBER. K-1 KNOWS JOSE RASCO AS LEADER
IN DEMOCRATIC CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT IN MIAMI. STATION CARD ON JOSE
RASCO LISTS HIM AS PRESIDENT OF "MOVIMIENTO DEMOCRATA CRISTIANO
DE CUBA" AS OF AUGUST 1968. CARD ALSO INDICATES THAT "GOBERNACION"
HAS A CLASSIFIED FILE ON JOSE RASCO.

WHOM K-1 IS ASSOCIATED PROFESSIONALLY, NAMES AND BIO DATA ON ALL
CUBAN EXILES. SLOTH-21 SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR THE NAMES OF IN-
DIVIDUALS REFERRING PEOPLE TO DR. CRUCET.

D. SLOTH-21 HAS INSTRUCTED K-1 TO INFILTRATE AND BECOME
INDISPENSABLE TO THE "CIRCULO CUBANO DE MEXICO." SLOTH-21 SPECIF-
ICALLY ASKED FOR THE IDENTITY OF THE "CIRCULO" OFFICIAL WHO CONTROLS
THE CLUB'S MAILING LIST AND DISTRIBUTES PROPAGANDA TO EXILES.
SLOTH-21 HOPEFUL THAT ONCE K-1 REACHES A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE
CLUB THAT HE CAN SERVE AS SPOTTER AND ARRANGE FOR FILM SHOWINGS
WITH FILMS PROVIDED BY SLOTH-21. INTERESTINGLY, WHEN K-1 TOLD
SLOTH-21 THAT HE (K-1) MIGHT MAKE A SHORT SPEECH AT THE CLUB DURING
MAY 1974 CUBAN INDEPENDENCE CEREMONIES, SLOTH-21 CAUTIONED HIM
AGAINST SAYING ANYTHING CRITICAL OF CASTRO REGIME. ALSO OF INTEREST
IS FACT SLOTH-21 DECLINED REIMBURSE K-1 FOR "CIRCULO" ENTRANCE
FEES. SLOTH-21 INSISTED THAT IF K-1 BELIEVES IN "THE REVOLUTION"
HE WILL ADD THE COST OF FEE ONTO THE BILL OF ONE OF HIS CAPITALIST
PATIENTS.

E. BASED ON REPORT TO SLOTH-21 THAT K-1'S FRIEND AND
FELLOW "NUEVA GENERACION" MEMBER, RAFAEL ANGEL QUEVEDO,
PLANS VISIT MEXICO AND HOPES SETTLE HERE. SLOTH-21 ASKED

IF K-1 COULD GET QUEVEDO TO COOPERATE WITH CUBAN GOVERNMENT AS
K-1 IS DOING. K-1 TOLD SLOTH-21 THAT HE THOUGHT THIS WAS A
POSSIBILITY. (ACTUALLY, K-1 IS ALMOST CERTAIN QUEVEDO, WHOM
HE DESCRIBED AS ANTI-CASTRO AND ANTI-COMMUNIST, WOULD "COOPERATE"
WITH CUBANS ONLY IF HE WERE RECRUITED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT.)

2. IN ORDER INSPIRE K-1 IN HIS OVERT ROLE, SLOTH-21 TOLD HIM
STORY ABOUT TONY SANTIAGO, CUBAN MILITARY COMMANDER WHO PRETENDED
TO WORK FOR BKHERALD AND WAS VIEWED BY CUBANS AS A TRAITOR UNTIL
THE STORY OF HIS DOUBLE AGENT ROLE CAME TO LIGHT AFTER HIS DEATH
AT HANDS OF BKHERALD." PRESUME THIS STORY KNOWN TO ADDRESSEES.

3. SLOTH-21 TOLD K-1 THAT "HAVANA" WANTED HIM AVAILABLE FOR
BRIEF ASSIGNMENT TO CARACAS IN JULY OR AUGUST 1974. HE IS TO
TAKE HIS WIFE TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT HE IS ON HOLIDAY. K-1 TOLD
SLOTH-21 THAT HE COULD MAKE THE TRIP IF HE HAD SUFFICIENT ADVANCE
NOTICE AND KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IS EXPECTED OF HIM. K-1 HAS INVITA-
TION FROM CLAY OFFICIALS EMILIO MASPERO AND EDUARDO
GARCIA TO VISIT CARACAS NEXT SUMMER, SO HE COULD COVER
BOTH MATTERS DURING ONE TRIP. K-1 WILL MAKE TRIP ONLY IF WE
CONCUR AND ONLY IF HE IS CERTAIN THAT RISK IS MINIMAL. IT WOULD
APPEAR SLIME PLANS USE HIM AS COURIER OF SOME SORT.
