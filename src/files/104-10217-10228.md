TIME/PLACE: Safe House #2, 1000, Jan 25

PRESENT: Kulpa, Aptect, Lavend

1.  Purpose of this meeting was to inform Kulpa that Headquarters had agreed to his trip to the Congo and to pass on instructions re: McInturff. I said that he had not yet received instructions from Holden and that the latter planned to be in [city name] Saturday. He would send the airline ticket from that city. Also, that Sarge Michal had agreed that the first six covers on the refrique evolutionaire (f) would be shot by K. K. hit us up for a light meter since he said that his present one was broken and since he had to take (330) pictures prior to his departure for the Congo which he anticipated would be either early or mid next week.

2.  Another twist was that he had been contacted by Gibson. Gibson informed him that a certain Dave Kette, who runs a highly suspect asset in New York City, had written to Gibson asking him for photos to use and forward several of K.'s negatives. Since all Kulpa promised to get more facts.

3.  The rest of the meeting was taken up straightening out his accountings.

4.  Next meeting: 1000 Tuesday 29 Jan
