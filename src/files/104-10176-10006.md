1. Forwarded herewith as attachment #1 are four reports on the latest developments of the LIRING-3 operation prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON and dated 5, 10, 11, and 12 December 1968. The most important points covered in these reports are as follow:

a. LIRING-3 made contact on 5 December with one Humberto *GONZALEZ Vega (no Station traces), who has apparently been designated by the FAR as the latter's contact with LIRING-3 in Mexico City. A description and a sketch of GONZALEZ provided by LIRING-3 are contained in ROWTON's 10 December report.

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH HMMA - 36114

b. According to GONZALEZ, Identity D, who left for Guatemala with LIRING-3 and, according to the latter, was probably executed after a period of detention, may still be alive and may have made a "deal" with the Guatemalan authorities. Identity D had apparently misappropriated FAR funds before going to Guatemala. LIRING-9's remarks to LIRING-3, as mentioned in ROWTON's report of 5 December, may be connected with Identity D's misdoings.

c. LIRING-3 hinted to LIRING-9 that he may accept a teaching job at the University of Jalapa. (Such a job was indeed recently offered to him.) LIRING-9 advised LIRING-3 not to accept this as he would much rather send him on a trip to PBRUMEN.

d. From a letter received from Gustavo *COLINDRES Barrios, LIRING-3 gathered that the BARRIOS brothers (Miguel and Juan Leon) may soon be released and may, in fact, contact him in Mexico City. The original text of that letter and its envelope are forwarded under separate cover as attachment #2. LIRING-3 interpreted some remarks made to him by Humberto GONZALEZ as another indication of a possible contact by the BARRIOS brothers in the near future. LIRING-3 plans to write back to the address given by COLINDRES and mention that he is in contact with GONZALEZ in the hope of getting a reaction from COLINDRES.

2. The Station plans to check further the identity given by GONZALEZ. Among other things, an attempt will be made via LIKAYAK-2 to check whether a file in that name exists in the archives of the Mexican Ministry of "Gobernacion." The Station may, at a later date, attempt spot surveillance of GONZALEZ. Meanwhile, any information that can be provided by the Guatemala City Station to further identify GONZALEZ would be appreciated.

CONTACT REPORT

1. Agent: LIRING/3
2. Date and Site of Meeting: 1100, 5/12/68; Identity A
3. Next Meeting: 1700, 6/12/68; Iden A
4. Administrative:

5 December, 1968

Rowton asked LIRING/3 to rent a small apartment that
they could use as a safehouse, in lieu of
Iden A, for the future. This was not only in the interest
of economy, but for obvious security reasons. Rowton gave
LIRING/3 1,500 pesos as an advance for this purpose.

5. Reports/Information Passed by Agent:

LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that he had dropped into the
LIRING office on 4/12/68 in the hope of running into the
LIRING Chief so that he could mention to him casually the
proposed trip to PBRUMEN at the end of the month. LIRING/3
told Rowton that he did not see the Chief inasmuch as he
was intercepted by LIRING/9. The latter appeared as cor-
dial as on the previous occasion, but this time made a
brief reference to LIRING/3's report. He asked: "Are you
sure you included everything?" L/3 told Rowton that he
replied in a rather puzzled tone, "Of course. Everything,
this is, that I could remember." To which L/9 explained:
"I mean about the 'motivos' of the arrest. It seems there's
more to it than you wrote. We have some interesting data
on that subject. We'll discuss it with you on Friday."
LIRING/3 then reported to Rowton that when he and LIRING/4
dropped in to
Identity B
on 3/12/68
the secretary of the Director,
Identity C, gave them a message that a person by the name
of Humberto Gonzalez Vega, residing at Calle Manzanillo
42, in apartment 8, had visited Iden B several times
asking for the address of LIRING/3.
LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that he attempted to contact
Humberto Gonzalez Vega at the address given on 4/12/68 but
was told by a woman of about 35 years of age with a slight
Guatemalan accent that he was out at the time. She took
L/3's address with interest and suggested that L/3 return
after 1500 the following day in the event Gonzalez did not
contact him at his home. L/3 told Rowton that he guessed
(and hoped that this was "Favel".

10 December 1968

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Contact with Humberto González Vega.

1. At 1000 on 9/12/68 at Identity A, LIRING/3 reported to Rowton
that he had met with Humberto González Vega on 5 and 6 December. He re-
lated that he had gone back to the apartment on Calle Manzanillo on the
afternoon of 5 December, met González and made a date to see him again
on the morning of 6 December. When he returned about 1030 on that day
González' wife said that he had just stepped out to telephone the embassy
of Ecuador. L/3 went out and found González at a nearby telephone booth
and managed to have a relatively detailed chat with him.

2. According to L/3, González started off by saying that he had been looking
forward to meeting L/3 for some time, since he had heard a great deal about
him from mutual friends. González went on to say that although he had been
away from Guatemala for the past four years, he kept in touch with his
friends there. He dropped the names of Sandoval Alegría, Jorge Torrón and
a certain Avecillas (phon) who he assumed were known to LIRING/3. He con-
cluded his introductory remarks with the statement that he hoped he and
L/3 would become friends, since they could be of mutual help.

3. González added that he was making a living selling books and was planning
to open a book store at the University. He indicated that he might be able
to help L/3 financially if the latter were interested in this business ven-
ture. González then stated that he was aware of L/3's arrest and detention
and alleged that he had advance information concerning L/3's trip to Guate-
mala in the company of Identity D. He then asked L/3 whether
he knew the real purpose of Iden D trip. When L/3 replied in a non-committal
way, González alleged that Iden D had been accused of misappropriation of funds
and took the trip in the hope of defending himself against these charges.
González then produced a typewritten letter, undated and addressed to himself
and signed by "Cruz", advising him of the charges against Iden D. González
told L/3 that the letter was from FAR headquarters and was received some time
before Iden D and L/3 left on their trip.

4. González then went on to say that he and his friends were not at all certain
that Iden D had been executed, as L/3 and many other people assumed. He stated
that some months ago Iden D mother in Mexico City had received a letter from
him informing her that he was then at Salamá (phon). González added that it
was not to be excluded that Iden D had made some sort of deal with the authorities
to save his skin in exchange for services he might perform against Far in the
future.

5. González then cautioned L/3 against indiscriminate contacts with persons

--- Page 6 ---

14-00000

representing themselves to be from legitimate "revolutionary" movements.
González recounted that he himself had to go into hiding for the previous
two months as a result of his having been exposed to a certain Nuñez who
had arrived in Mexico City with a group of Guatemalan exiles. González des-
cribed Nuñez as a known member of the "Mano Blanca" and a former police
officer ("tercero jefe de la Judicial").

6. González then asked L/3 whether he had made any close friends while in
Guatemala. This, L/3 felt, was an attempt to smoke out his relationship with
the Barrios brothers ( Miguel and Juán León Barrios). He told Rowton that he
evaded the issue by giving a vague reply, to which González replied: "Well,
I hope to have a great surprise for you soon ('alegría')" González then
suggested that they meet again on 12 December and promised to visit L/3 at
his home in the company of his wife, "so that L/3's and his wife could keep
each other company while they themselves were talking in L/3's apartment."
L/3 told Rowton that he shot this idea down by explaining that although his
wife was revolutionary and trustworthy, he preferred to keep any political
discussions strictly between himself and González. The latter, then suggested
that he simply drop by L/3's house and that they both proceed somewhere for
a coffee on a suitable pretext.

7. LIRING/3 described Humberto González Vega as a "rather tall" man (about 1.78)
heavy (about 85-90 k.), apparent age 42, with light eyes ("ojos claros") and
straight ("lacio") black hair. He drew Rowton the attached sketch for possible
identification.

8. IIRING/3 agreed with Rowton that it was advisable for him to tell LIRING/9
at his next meeting of his contact with González Vega to provoke a reaction
from the LIRING establishment.

11 December, 1968

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Contact with LIRING/9 and LIRING/10.

1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1300 on 10 December, 1968, that he had
finally succeeded in talking again with LIRING/9. He related that when
he went to the LIRING office as requested at about 1030 on 9/12/68 he was
told by the receptionist that LIRING/9 was still out. L/3 was asked to
telephone later, about 1300, to check whether L/9 had returned. LIRING/3
telephoned, as requested, a little after 1300 (in Rowton's presence) but
was told that LIRING/9 had not returned. L/3 left a message for L/9 that
he would come to his office again the following morning.

2. LIRING/3 continued that he reappeared at the LIRING office about the
same time the next day (10/12/68) and was told this time by the receptionist
(the wife of LIRING/10's assistant) that LIRING/9 was in. At this moment
LIRING/9 himself emerged from his office with papers in his hand, winked
at LIRING/3, and returned without addressing him. Minutes later L/3
was told by the receptionist that L/9 would see him. The following is
Rowton's reconstruction of the conversation that took place between LIRING/3
and LIRING/9, based on L/3's report to Rowton:

L/3: "Come in. I'm sorry I couldn't see you Friday or yesterday. I
was out of town."
L/9: "It's alright with me, except that I have a number of things
pending as far as my own plans are concerned."
L/9: "Well, how are you doing?"
L/3: "Fairly well. I just received a letter from my good friend, Prof.
Carlo Antonio Castro of the University of Veracruz. He has been
insisting that I go down to Jalapa to see him. He wants to or-
ganize an exposition and also to offer me an interesting position
at the University."
L/9: "But would that mean that you would have to stay in Jalapa?"
L/3: "Yes, of course; that is, if I accept. It's a tempting solution
to my personal problems. As I told you I'd still up in the air!"
L/9: "But I don't think that's the solution. A trip would be much
better."
L/3: "Yes, but I have to make a decision soon. Also my wife received a
letter from her father inviting her to New York. Here's the
letter. Do you want to read it?"
L/9: "No. What does it say?"
L/3: "Her father says that he can give her medical certificates to
prove he is very sick so that she can get a visa without any

--- Page 9 ---

14-00000

difficulty."

L/9: "But as I said before, she shouldn't go to the American Embassy.
Keep her away from it. That would be bad, as I explained last
time."

L/3: "I'm doing my best, but it's not easy. Things are still up in
the air with us."

(At about this moment in the conversation, LIRING/10 entered the office, and,
after greeting LIRING/9 rather perfunctorily, carried on the following con-
versation with LIRING/3:)

L/10: "How have you been?"
L/3: "Rather well, thanks?"
L/10: "And your wife? Is she recovering from the strain?"
L/3: "Just about. The nightmare is finally over and she feels better
now."
L/10: "Well I hope you'll come by here often - as often as you like.
We enjoy chatting with you."

(After this brief exchange, LIRING/10 left the office.)

L/3: "By the way, how is your Chief doing? I'd like to drop in to
express my appreciation for the interest he and his wife
showed in helping my wife during my absence."
L/9: "Well, he's not doing too well."
L/3: "Ch, another thing. I finally met that Guatemalan 'Pavel' I
mentioned in my report."
L/9: "Yes, how did it go?"
L/3: "His name is Humberto González Vega. He's been in Mexico for some
time. A former activist in the PTG. You must know him."
L/9: "Yes."
L/3: "He wants to see me again on Thursday for a more detailed talk."
L/9: "Fine. Well, I hope you keep coming around to see us whenever
you can."

4. LIRING/3 commented to Rowton that he felt that LIRING/10's intrusion had
not been coincidental, and that L/9 had advised him of L/3's arrival before
he himself received L/3 into his office.

12 December, 1968

Subject: LIRING/3 Receipt of Letter from Gustavo Colindres.

1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1700 on 12/12/68 that he had received
a letter from Gustavo Colindres, a Guatemalan of about 40 years of age
whom he had met in the Pavón prison in Guatemala City. LIRING/3 stated
that Colindres is the uncle (mother's side) of the León Barrios brothers,
although he does not have the same name of sra. Barrios. L/3 explained
that they were born of different fathers. L/3 added that Colindres was
imprisoned some 18 months ago for responsibility in an arms cache dis-
covered in or near his home.

2. The following is Rowton's translation of the original letter which
ZIRING/3 gave Rowton for copying:

"I hope that when you arrived in your Mexico, you found only peace
and satisfaction in being once again in the warmth of your home.
Here on the farm we have missed you and felt badly at not hearing
from the artist and the professor, and now that I have succeeded in
obtaining your address, I am taking the liberty of dropping your a
few lines. I want you both to keep abreast of what's going on at
the old farm, even though we're still struggling to turn it over to
new owners, but they haven't as yet agreed to the price. I guess
I'll be the last to leave the ship, since I haven't a chance to get
off. The lions are the next to leave their cage. 'Lorenzana' left
a month ago and the Queen left on the 2nd of December. Promise me
that when you take a drink you'll toast the farm and the date that
is approaching.

My best to your wife, kisses to your child and my best wishes for
your welfare. May this year of strange experiences engrave in your
mind the memory of a friend.

Guat. 7/12/68 /s/ G.Colindres

Please send your correspondence to me in the name of my wife, Isabel
Donis de Colindres, 5 av. y 7a Calle, lote 6-Manzana 26, Colonia Santa
Marta, Zona 19, Guat.Cuidad, América Central."

3. LIRING/3 told Rowton he understood the "lions are next to leave their
cage" to mean that the León Barrios brothers are soon to be released and
that this letter is a signal to him to be on the alert for a contact from
them in the near future. L/3 told Rowton that he intended to reply to this

--- Page 11 ---

14-00000

letter at once, and to take the occasion to mention casually that he
has met a Guatemalan in Mexico City by the name of Humberto González
Vega who seems to know everyone there quite well. L/3 hopes that this
will provoke some sort of comment from the León Barrios brothers wither
directly or indirectly.

4. LIRING/3 stated that Gustavo Colindres, who is still in the Pavón
prison, obviously snuggled out this letter through his wife who visits
him regularly. L/3 commented that Colindres told him that he is a faith-
ful FAR member, but refused to belong to the PTG, or even to accept the
financial aid doled out at the Pavón prison by Francisco Corado, the PTG
representative there.

"Situacion General:"

Durante los dias que permaneci en la celda
del 2° Cuerpo de policia tuve oportunidad de
cambiar impresiones con Rolando Ortiz "Cebolli-
ta" sobre la situación General de Guatemala es-
pecialmente de FAR, por aquel entonces Cesar Montes
no habia sido destituido y se iniciaba una cam-
paña de Terrible represion por parte del gobierno;
de acuerdo con las informaciones se desprende
lo siguiente: la division entre PGT y FAR
provoca una situación dificil pues algunos miem-
bros del PGT se inclinan a este y pasaron
teoricamente a las filas de FAR. Aunque el
PGT dice apoyar la lucha armada e
incluso dice disponer de contingentes en la
montaña (zona de Zacapa?) lo cierto es que
en la practica no apoya en lo mas minimo
a la linea de FAR, esto es a grandes
rangos ya que los detalles son bien conocidos.
En los últimos tiempos el PGT
trata de abandonar las divergencias. Como ejemplo
la situación que presencie en Pavon, donde el
representante del PGT trataba de ganar
adeptos entre los polcos pertenecientes a FAR
ofreciéndoles ayuda económica - incidiendo en

--- Page 18 ---

14-00000

que la linea (FAR) no es la equívoca en
muchos aspectos.
Al mismo tiempo You Dosa Comandante
General se esperaba que el grupo
de noviembre se aglutinara.
Teoricamente esta aglutinación se llevó a cabo, pero
en la práctica se ha demostrado que este
grupo sigue actuando por su cuenta anar-
quicamente.
Todas estas divisiones, fal-
ta de organización falta de madurez ideolo-
gica etc. han traido por consecuencia un
debilitamiento de la lucha armada en
Guatemala. A esto contra el fortale-
cimiento cada vez mayor de las fuerzas re-
presivas obra de los norteamericanos,
bien equipado con las armas más moder-
nas of asesorado of entrenado por ellos, ve-
mos la situación en la
montaña. In consecuencia de Todo esto
ha sido la intensificación de la Guerrilla
Urbana, for jovenes de FAR han tenido
que bajar a la Ciudad y hacen esfuerzos
desesperados pero anárquicos para

--- Page 19 ---

14-00000

por ejemplo
por
realizar acciones que muchas veces, muerte
All Embajador Gorden main
traen consecuencias negativas, o que
fucina as vice intensifican la repre-
sión acabando con cuadros valiosos
més. En la montaña se han sufrido reveres
muy grandes, la muerte de Nestor Valle,
Efigenio, la de Camilo en la ciudad etc. lean
dibilitado aun mas las acciones de FAR, pues
las especiales Circunstancias que hoy se
viven en Guatemala impiden la rápida in
sustitución de estos cuadros. La falta de
fondos para financiamiento es uno de los
grandes problemas, pues
el dinero tiene que conseguirse a base de
Realted a Imprecas Comerciales, dando por
resultado cometer acciones que por conseguir
una cantidad pequeña han muerto varios
revolucionarios.

En mis charlas con los hermanos de
León Barrios se me hizo notar el sentido
negativo que algunos aspectos de la ayuda
Cubana representa. De Critics diramente
a los cuadros que se formaban alla, pries
según dicen, en Cuba semadaptaban

--- Page 20 ---

14-00000

a la realidad Guatemalteca, o. podian
evitar conflictos a veces innecesarios. El mejor
ejemplo es el reciente caso de Cesar Montes
destituido por no liaberse incorporado a
la realidad del momento militar.
En Guatemala existe un fuerte nacionalis-
mo; por esto los jovenes de FAR rechazan
cierto tipo de ayuda procedente de Cuba;
se habla mucho entre ellos de fracasos
obtenidos por los formados allá y
de un supuesto control Cubano de ayudarlos
muchise con miembros.

Por ahora, hablando francamente
la lucha en Guatemala se ha debilitado.
for golpes sufridos han sido muchos of fuentes
es de extrema urgencia una reorganiza-
ción de los
aspectos
para el desarrollo de la lucha armada

--- Page 21 ---

14-00000

en Guatemala es una mayor comprensión
de la situación interna de ese país, y por
consiguiente la ayuda más adecuada.
Es evidente que el fortalecimiento de
esta lucha sera a largo plazo, pero para ello
es necesario que la ayuda sea mas efectiva
y realista, de acuerdo con las opiniones de
los cuadros de FAR.

En general, otro abastecimiento
de medios que sean necesarios.
Por lo que a mi respecta, creo que
Tengo que seguir hablando
con las FAR; la especial situación
de ser ex-preso politico, mis experiencias personales y
la Confianza que ellos me depositan han
hecho que mantenga mis contactos, exper-
ando por estos días la llegada de una
persona muy responsable que me busca-
ra con el nombre de PAVEL, para seguir
trabajando en un sentido positivo.

Antecedentes

En Mexico y por conducto de Carlos Perzabal
Marcué, estableci contacto con F. L. Barrios
Guatemalteco quien según se me informó era
FAR encargado de la pro-
paganda en esta ciudad. Para Barrios Tema
necesidad de hacer un viaje a Guatemala, pero
dada su situación de exilado político no podia
abandonar el pais en forma legale y por ese
motivo se me pidió ayuda, ya que
por Tener conocimiento de la region
del país y además
establecido en San Cristobal las Casas estaba
la posibilidad de llevar a Fara Barrios hasta
la Ciudad de Guatemala
A Traves de unas pláticas Tenidas
con él se llegó a la conclusión de que
además de realizar dicho viaje,
podriamos
hacer algunos movimientos que tuvieron
por finalidad prestar una ayuda efec-
tiva a las FAR.
