Dependent Payment for Case #103, Jorge FUNDORA Fernandez

Action: Reply to paragraph three

1. A letter dated 7 May 1967 has been received from Silvia
HEREDIA, 180 S.E. 13th Terrace, Miami, Florida, via the AMTIKI-1
facility. Mrs. HEREDIA is the widow of Jorge FUNDORA Fernandez
(Hero & Martyr, no 201 number) who is the Subject of Case #103 for
which a monthly AMBUD payment of $175.00 is made to the widow. In
her letter, which is attached, Mrs. HEREDIA requests the AMTIKI facility
to also send the payment formerly received from AMBIDDY-1 which she
claims was terminated in April 1967.

2. This case was one of three cases for which AMBIDDY requested
in January 1967 that WOFACT assume the monthly payments being made by
his organization. The request by AMBIDDY was the Subject of Reference
A which requested data from JMWAVE concerning the cases. The JMWAVE
reply, forwarded under Reference B, included a recommendation that no
increase in payment be made. Reference C informed the addressee that,
under the circumstances, it was not possible for Headquarters to take
any action to provide support to the individuals concerned.

3. In view of the background described above, we propose, with
Headquarters approval, to have AMTIKI-1 reply to Mrs. HEREDIA stating
that no funds are available in addition to the $175.00 monthly payment
which is being made.

4. We are also enclosing copies of the following documentation
which has been provided by Mrs. HEREDIA:

Miami, May 7, 1967

Sirs:

By means of these lines I wish to tell you of my present
situation with the hope that you can help me.

My name is Silvia HEREDIA, widow of Jorge FUNDORA, and I
have been receiving from you a pension of $175.00 monthly.
Since this sum was insufficient to cover the needs of my two
children, Eduardo who is 8 years old and Raquel who is 7 years
old, and the psychiatric treatment for myself,

AMBIDDY-1 sent me $125.00 monthly.
In the month of August 1966, that amount (from the AMBIDDY-1) was
reduced to $100.00 for economic reasons and in the month of
April 1967 I was notified that this amount would be suspended
entirely and that I should not count of this subsidy in the future.

My situation cannot be sustained because due to my health
I am not able to work at the moment and I am turning to you with
the request that the sum suspended by the AMBIDDY-1 which was sent to me
be assigned to me by you.

Respectfully,
Silvia Heredia Vda. de Fundora
180 SE 14 Terrace
Miami, Fla.

Miami, Mayo 7, 1967

Señores:

Por medio de estas lineas deseo expresarles mi actual si-
tuación con la esperanza de que puedan ayudarme.

La que suscribe es Silvia Heredia, viuda de Jorge Fundora
y que viene recibiendo de ustedes una pensión de $175.00
mensuales. Como esa cantidad era insuficiente para atender
mis dos hijos, Eduardo de 8 años y Raquel de 7 años, asi como
el tratamiento siquiatrico que estoy sometida, el AMBIDDY-1
me enviaba $125.00 mensuales. En el mes de Agosto de 1966 dicha cantidad quedó redu-
cida a $100.00 por reajustes económicos, y el mes de Abril
de 1967 se me comunicó que tenia que suspender definitiva-
mente esa cantidad por no contar más con la subvención con
que contaba.

Como mi situación se hace insostenible ya que por mi salud no
puedo trabajar por el momento acudo a ustedes con el ruego de que
se me asigne la cantidad suspendida por el AMBIDDY-1 que me hacia
llegar el MRR.

De ustedes muy respetuosamente,
Silvia Heredia Vda. de Fundora

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT: Status Report - Transfer of AMBUD
Survivor Benefit Payments to BEC

1. Mr. Bon DeFelice, Chief, Benefits and Services
Division, was phoned on 8 May for a reading on the status
of the AMBUD case, i.e., researching the possibility of
transferring Survivor Benefit Payments (which total close
to $500,000.00 per year) to the Bureau of Employee
Compensation.

2. Mr. DeFelice assured WH/COG that whatever could
be done was being done and a decision on the feasibility
of the turnover was being made by the Director, BEC.
Sample Survivor cases had been submitted to BEC for review
along with the proposed text of a letter which would be
addressed to the BEC by the DCI once the course to be
followed was agreed upon by both parties. The draft
letter had been prepared by Mr. Lawrence Houston.

3. Mr. DeFelice will advise WH/COG as soon as he
has word.
