OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

1. Identity was originally contacted by JMPALM Case Officer in mid-1963. The results of Identity's assessment by the JMPALM Case Officer were reported in detail in Reference B. It later developed that Identity was an acquaintance of AMPAL-1 who was subsequently put in contact with Identity for training and subsequent recruitment.

2. Training sessions continued between AMPAL-1 and Identity through most of November and early December 1963. As in other newly recruited JMPALM assets, the agent was regularly critiqued as to the value of his information and was provided with regular guidance in order to better strengthen his value to JMPALM. Following is a list of those persons with whom the subject is in contact on a regular basis or with whom he corresponds frequently:

a. Dominican Air Force Colonel (Pedro RRENCE) who visited Miami from the Dominican Republic. RRENCE plans to return to Miami in early 1964.

b. Antonio ALLANO Font, Cuban newspaperman now living in the Dominican Republic who occasionally visits the Miami area.

c. Retired Dominican Army Colonel [Fernando CARTAGENA] who resides in Miami, but who maintains regular correspondence with many Dominican military figures.

d. Edward DENIS, Haitian exile currently residing in Miami, who corresponds regularly with several Haitian youth leaders who are in opposition to Duvalier and who visit Miami from time to time.
