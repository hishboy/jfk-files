ABSTRACT

1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become available for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, this Station can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high enough priority to cover.

2. For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957, 1960 and 1961; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue the coverage.

3. Presently, Elena VASQUEZ Gomez, one of the persons referred to in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro-Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VASQUEZ Gomez.

ABSTRACT

1. Project LIFEAT has been renewed for the period of 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00.

2. Please note that this means a cut of $3,193.00 from the Station's original request for $102,193.00 to $99,000.00. WHD was allocated $99,000.00 for this Project for FY 63.

3. This reduction was made by reducing "Miscellaneous Op Expenses" from $5,000.00 to $807.00.

4. KUTURE and KUDESK Staffs concurred in recommending renewal. KUDESK reiterated that the facilities of this Project could and should be used for the coverage of known or highly suspected agents of the Soviet/Satellite and Cuban intelligence services in Mexico. KUDESK notes that some twenty of these agents have been documented in detailed target studies which were forwarded to the Station.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director, Plans

THROUGH: DDP/PG

SUBJECT: Project LIFEAT (Renewal)

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

FROM: Mexico City 23592

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented for renewal for the period 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963. The project supports a unilateral telephone tap operation which provides daily information on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico City and personnel thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and groups.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $99,000 from the DD/P-WH Division budget in fiscal year 1963, subject to the availability of funds. Of this amount $16,800 is estimated for administrative salaries; $43,415 for field agent salaries; $20,828 for basehouse rentals; $12,250 for equipment; $2,100 for local transportation; and $4,000 for miscellaneous operational expenses.

3. The Field Project Outline and review which are forwarded by the Division with a covering memorandum, give a clear description of the project activity and accomplishments. The project has been in continuous operation for eleven years, starting with a single tap against the Soviet Legation in Mexico City and now covering as many as thirty lines in a given month. The project is staffed by an "outside" case officer (Career Agent David M. WILSTED (p) of Project LINOG), four contract agents who do administrative work, and twenty-one field agents including monitors and linesmen. During the past year the project provided coverage of the home phones of three Soviet Intelligence officers, the Polish Embassy, the Yugoslav Embassy, more than the transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba, American Communists in Mexico, and exile and revolutionary groups in Mexico. Much information was obtained and additional security was provided Station operations. Although coverage of the official Soviet and Czech Installations pose a joint operation with the Mexican Government in LIENVOY, Project LIFEAT remains available to resume coverage of these installations should a change in the local government or its attitude to CIA participation necessitate such change.

---

14-00000

4. For the future, the Station has hopes of employing LIFEAT assets in "hot mike" operations which will require access to telephone centrals and cables. It is the opinion of the Station that the support provided the Station operations, the CI/CE information, and the ability to cover sensitive targets without revealing our interest to liaison services justifies the expenditure of funds, time, and personnel under this project. The overall performance of all agents in the complex continued to be good; no security problems were encountered which were not solved by the personnel involved.

5. Appropriate Special Staff components recommend renewal. The FI Staff notes that the project continues to be a most useful operational asset of the Station and that the operation has produced thirty-seven positive intelligence disseminations, six of which were of particular interest concerning the illegal transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba. PI comments that information of direct interest to PI/D was received from Project LIFEAT and that the technical coverage of the diplomatic installations would afford valuable assistance to the planning and conduct of PI/D endeavors to mount operations. The CI Staff reiterates that the facilities of this project should be used for the coverage of known or highly suspected agents of the Soviet/Satellite and Cuban Intelligence services in Mexico. CI notes that some twenty of these agents have been documented in detailed target studies which were forwarded to the Station.

6. I recommend renewal of Project LIFEAT and invite the Division's attention to the recommendation of CI Staff in paragraph 4 above.

FI Staff recommends renewal of Project LIFEAT. This unilateral audio effort continues to be a most useful operational asset of the station as indicated by the specific examples furnished in the renewal request. In addition, it produced 37 positive intelligence disseminations, six of which were of particular interest concerning illegal transhipment of U.S. goods to Cuba.

Project LIFEAT WH/Mexico

(Audio Operation)

SECRET 9 July 1962

1. FI/INT files contain 37 positive information disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIFEAT during the year 1 July 1961 through June 1962. They were concerned principally with contacts between Mexican Communists or leftists and Cubans or individuals of the Soviet Bloc, and with the travel of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of particular interest consisted of information on Transcontinental S.A., a company allegedly engaged in the illegal transshipment of US goods to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo, now living in Mexico. There was reporting on Nicaraguan and Spanish exile activity in Mexico and on the revolutionary sentiment and expectations of other Latin American nationals.

2. LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO. It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production of positive information is incidental to the project's primary function as a support and CI/CE operation.

3. RENEWAL IS RECOMMENDED.

LIFEAT Project Renewal Request

1. It is requested that the attached LIFEAT Renewal Request be approved for the period of 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00, all of which falls within FY 1963. $99,000.00 was programmed for FY 1963 in the WHD allocation.

2. This Project provides the Mexico City Station with a unilateral telephone tap operation which has been in existence for the past 11 years.

3. While the primary object of this Project is not the production of positive intelligence, it was in whole or in part the source of 30 positive information disseminations. In addition to this production and support of other Station operations, it provides ODENVY with information concerning the American Communist Group in Mexico.

4. Emergency recontact instructions have not been established for the agents of this Project since it is believed the operation would cease in case a situation should arise where they would be applicable.

5. No training programs for any LIFEAT personnel are anticipated during the renewal period.

6. WH Division recommends renewal of the LIFEAT Project based on the attached field request. WH Division has cut the field request from $102,193.00 to $99,000.00.

I. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage

PROJECT LIFEAT

PROJECT REVIEW

As noted in last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage of the official Soviet installation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the parallel liaison project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the most active Soviet Intelligence officers. This was in response to the continuing Station CI program which includes the monitoring of Soviet contacts, and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT renewal. As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficient time to fully evaluate its usefulness. However, It is believed that such coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the CI field. Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product of this type has been obtained. Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist by Soviet Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962 (Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut TITOV will visit Mexico)

B. Polish Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the only successful, continuing penetration of the target. The information provided to the Interested Case Officer has in the past been described as "unique" and "invaluable". This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as well as the past. Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence product of this coverage are:

HMMA-17448, 28 July 1961 (Henryk POTASZ)

HMMA-17647, (LIFEAT/LAURICLE), 25 August 1961

C. Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U.S. goods transshipment via Mexico to Cuba. This technical operation not only provided initial leads which alerted the Station to these companies, but also was able to provide continuing information on the daily activities of the companies involved. Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their contacts and general activities. Samples of the positive intelligence production from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:

HMMA-18073, 31 October 1961 (Ruben SAUREZ Y Alvarez, Representative in Mexico of the Cuban Bank of Foreign Commerce)

HMMA-18538, 2 February 1962 (Cuban Commercial Activities)

HMM-6220, 27 February 1962 (Lorenzo L. SAUNDERS, Vice President of Transcontinental, S.A.)

D. American Communists in Mexico

As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been partially processed by them. During the period July 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of take were passed to local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable information gleaned from the targets in this field continues to deal with contacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM).

HMMA-18827, 10 April 1962 (Albert MALTZ/Noah SEBORER/ Charles SMALL)

E. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and not available from other sources. The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more recently Spanish Republican exiles. The product has been most rewarding in this coverage. Examples of productivity in this past project year:

HMMA-17489, 4 August 1961 (Alejandro GALINDO)

HMMA-18420, 5 January 1962 (Teodora MARTEN Rodriguez)

HMMA-18468, 16 January 1962 (Travel of Salvadorans to Cuba)

HMM-6379, 11 May 1962 (Opinion of Spanish Republican Exiles on Current Strikes in Spain)

F. Counter-Intelligence Information

By its latest Related Mission Directive, Mexico City Station's major responsibilities continue to lie in the field of CI/CE matters. LIFEAT was able to provide a valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. In this field. Coverage included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who is acting in a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Besides the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field, the following informational reporting was provided:

HMM-5742, 7 July 1961 (Travel of Mexican Leftists Behind Iron Curtain)

HMM-5836, 18 August 1961 (Activities of Mexican Student of the University of Peoples’ Friendship)

HMM-5977, 24 October 1961 (Interview of Prominent Marxist with Polish Conselor)

HMM-6377, 11 May 1962 (Scholarship for Study in Warsaw to Jorge TAMAYO, Jr., Mexican Marxist Intellectual)

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and generally providing other Station operations the secure support only available through a unilateral telephone tap operation. The following is a selected list, together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support and leads provided through LIFEAT:

---

14-0000

LIFEAT/Cuban: The most noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts in the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the activities of Transcontinental, S.A. in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials to Cuba via Mexico. LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones Mexicanas, S.A. and changing its location and telephone number. Valuable information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime, methods and contacts used in their procurement, and information on the contacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained.

LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech Intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more importantly, provided greater security to KUBARK when one of their CLS officers, Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt. Through LIFEAT "livemonitoring" of both the original and followup defection attempts, the KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapment of the KUBARK personnel involved.

LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the most "classic" example of the use of a telephone tap in providing a lead which could develop into a vital penetration of the Polish intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's development of the operation. It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year. (Full information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEXI 0463). Also of great interest to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ, Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which had been stolen in the U.S. and driven to Mexico. In this operation, in which a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided not only the initial leads, but also daily operational information vital to the Station's efforts in this case.

LIFEAT/Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target. Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital data on personalities, contacts, and services obtained by the target establishment must be provided. It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and will

---

14-00000

continue to provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting of any operations against the Yugoslav target.

LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed supporting information in backing Station double agent operations. In this area the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the agent. LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case officer to determine the veracity of the agent involved. LIFEAT also provides a needed check upon the activities of the double agent.

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the senior ODACID official in Mexico. LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile factions both involved in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage of targets in this area also enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and activities of the various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile community in Mexico City.

LIFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the reporting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and Leftists, to Cuba. Through coverage of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted "Hollywood Ten" to regain their former status in the U.S. film industry.

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has been enhanced through LIFEAT periodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1 and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or personnel. Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations.

H. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the ability of the unilateral LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest

---

14-00000

to the liaison forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel, and security risk. As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's involvement in the parallel, but liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by the present local government administration or a change in government administrations could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project. For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy coverage, must be available to once again undertake coverage of the official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall into the Soviet-Czech coverage. It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

I. There is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations.

II. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time. For this reason percentage figures as to completion of project objectives cannot be drawn. However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced in the period July 1961 through May 1962. LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered.

III. Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so.

Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to reveal its interest or operations to the liaison forces involved in the LIENVOY operation.

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing LIFEAT assets in "hot mike operations which require access to telephone

---

14-0000

centrals and cables. The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation has already been proven, in a recent operation with the LIERODE installation as a target. Seven reels of "hot mike" take were obtained in test runs on checking both the operation (including installation of the "miked" instrument in the office of the head of the LIERODE official installation) and the equipment which was of radical design and conceived and built by the KURIOT technician assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, before continuous operation could get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon complete renovation of its telephone system, including the installation of a switchboard. This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against this particular target, unless a direct line is installed there. However, it is the intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of interest. In these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and series cross maintenance, basehouse procurement and maintenance, and processing of take. From the brief test runs via the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly aid the Station in Its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission Directive.

IV. Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex continued to be good during the period of the project review, with security being stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountered which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Headquarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will continue to be sought on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 September 1961 for FY 1962 in the amount of $98,973.00. The proposed budget for FY 1963 is broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request, Part II, and totals $102,169.00

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline submitted herewith and in the individuals contracts and oral agreements (memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the various LIFEAT personnel.
