MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Thomas B. CASASIN
PERIOD COVERED: January - June 1974

Although I have been the Station case officer for Subject
only since January 1974, I have been acquainted with his performance
for the Station for the past 5 1/2 years through my assignment in
the French Branch at Headquarters and, for the past 2 1/2 years,
as the Station officer responsible for UNCAIRD operations. I
have always considered CASASIN to be a highly skilled, experienced
senior case officer thoroughly devoted to the work of BKHERALD.
He is becoming increasingly effective in his present cover position
at UNCAIRD, operating against both Soviet and PRC targets, and I
am delighted that he has agreed to continue his cooperation with
the Station as a field agent following his retirement from
BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974. CASASIN can look back with pride
over his years of service with BKHERALD but he can also look
forward to additional years of highly useful, productive work for
Paris Station.

CASASIN's attitude can best be summed up by a comment on my
first operational meeting with him following his official retire-
ment. He instinctively went immediately to a discussion of
operations, not of retirement. I am confident that CASASIN will
continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station,
and I wish him well.

IDENTIFICATION
SECTION I
The attached Memorandum in Lieu of a Fitness Report should
be read in conjunction with the NOC Status Report on Subject for
the period ending 31 March 1974; these reports overlap somewhat in
the period covered. As has been indicated by both Russell N.
SKOGSBERG who prepared Section I, and George T. HEMSLEY, who
prepared Section III of the NOC Status Report, Subject is an impressive
officer who has developed superb cover for himself but who has been
only reasonably effective in identifying, developing and turning
over useful access agents to the Station. While endorsing the
general thrust of the Memorandum in Lieu of a Fitness Report, the
undersigned also feels that Subject should bring a sharper focus
to bear on developing in-depth relationships with those persons
who have the potential of becoming quality access agents to
priority targets. Subject meets and knows many people in his
milieu, including Sovicts; he reports in considerable volume on
these contacts. We encourage him to concentrate on a few of
these contacts and to plumb them to their depths. The under-
signed joins SKOGSBERG in wishing Subject well and in paying
recognition to his motivation and his attitude.

Subject's Specific Duties remained essentially as described
in his previous Fitness Report (for the period 1 January - 31 December
1973). I would rate him on these Specific Duties as he was
previously rated.

FITNESS REPORT - FIELD TRANSMITTAL
SPECIAL NOTE
Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the description of specific duties of certain other em-
ployees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of specific duties
will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.
INSTRUCTIONS

Independent Contractor, Thomas B. CASASIN (P)

1. It is requested that the new contract for Thomas B.
CASASIN (P) include shipment of HHE for him and his dependents
and POV as well as storage of household effects.

2. CASASIN retired from the Agency 28 June 1974, and by
regulation is entitled to movement of HHE up to one year. An
extension of an additional six months can be requested, but
beyond that CASASIN would not be covered.

3. EUR has been granted approval to hire CASASIN under a
Paris Station project. His cover job contract has been approved
until May 1977, at which time he plans to return to the United
States.

4. Therefore, EUR recommends his contract include the
benefits of shipment of HHE, POV, and storage of goods to his
place of legal residence upon the successful completion of his
services.

SUBJECT
REFERENCE
Deputy Director for Operations
Request for Approval to Utilize
Thomas B. CASASIN (P) as an Independent
Contractor
DD/P 6-1818, 2 May 1966

1. Action Requested: The European Division requests
approval to utilize Thomas B. CASASIN (P) as an Independent
Contractor subject to the terms regarding employment of
annuitants as set forth in the reference. CASASIN has just
opted for retirement under the Agency Retirement Program
effective 28 June 1974.

2. Basic Data or Background: CASASIN, born 20 January
1924, has been employed by the Agency since 1949. He held
several positions in Headquarters and from February 1955
until October 1960 served in Tokyo. Until his departure for
Paris he served as a Branch Chief in the then SR Division.
In 1962 CASASIN was assigned to Paris under non-official
cover as a Staff Agent to work on the Soviet target. He
remained a Staff Agent until his conversion to Career Associate
status in 1972.

3. Staff Position: In 1972, with Paris Station approval,
CASASIN on his own initiative obtained an editorial position
with IDENTITY. This cover job affords him the unique oppor-
tunity to establish and maintain contact and access to a
variety of target personalities. Despite a heavy cover load,
he has been able to make useful operational contributions
E2 IMPDET
CL BY 055747
SECRET

14-00000
SECRET
to the overall Station effort against the Soviet Bloc and more
recently, the PRC target. His current appointment with
IDENTITY has recently been extended until 31 May 1977. We
would like to continue to utilize CASASIN's professional
talents and his natural sustained access to priority targets
in IDENTITY. CASASIN will retire at the GS-15 step 10 level.
In accordance with Agency regulations CASASIN's proposed
gross annual contract salary of $8,000 plus his annuity will
not exceed ninety percent of his salary at the time of
retirement.
4. Recommendation: It is requested that approval be
granted to employ Thomas B. CASASIN (P) as an Independent
Contractor.
