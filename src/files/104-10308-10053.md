IF DUTCH AUTHORITIES SUSPECT SABOTAGE OPS ORIGINATED ROTTERDAM IN SINGLE INSTANCE POSSIBILITY EXISTS CONVINCE THEM CUBAN EMIGRE GROUP AND NOT KUBARK INVOLVED, BUT AS SIMILAR ACTIONS CARRIED OUT IN FUTURE HIGHLY UNLIKELY THEY WOULD ACCEPT THIS PLOY. ALSO ALMOST CERTAIN DUTCH AUTHORITIES WOULD DRASTICALLY INCREASE SECURITY IN PORT AREA WHEN CUBAN VESSELS HERE, THUS MAKING FUTURE CONTACT ANY AMLEGS VERY DIFFICULT. SIMILAR SITUATION MIGHT OBTAIN BELGIAN AND GERMAN PORTS AS CONSEQUENCE DUTCH INTEL AND SECURITY SERVICES HIGHLY AWARE KUBARK KEEN INTEREST DUE TO THEIR HEAVY INVOLVEMENT OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST CUBAN TARGET.

BELIEVE POSSIBLE HE WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE IF SOME INDICATIONS SUCH A PLAN OCCURRED PRIOR HIS NEXT VOYAGE.

B. AMLEG 29 APPEARED GENUINELY INTERESTED PERFORMING INTERNAL SABOTAGE ON SHIP BUT AS CHIEF ENGINEER WOULD REQUIRE COLLABORATOR IN ENGINE ROOM SINCE HE DOES NOT TAKE REGULAR ENGINE ROOM DUTY AND HIS PRESENCE THERE ALWAYS FOR SPECIFIC INSPECTION WHICH OBSERVED BY MEN WHO ARE ON DUTY. HIS MOTHER IN PBRUMEN ON VERGE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AND ACTION HIS PART NOW WOULD REQUIRE HIS IMMEDIATE
