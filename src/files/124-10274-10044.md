On September 25, 1959, Jaffe, who is a good friend of the
Bureau and who did two radio shows on the New York Office, came by and talked
with Kemper.

Jaffe has been on the Khrushchev trip, and he said it was the most
hectic thing he has ever had to do in his life. He said there was no question about
Khrushchev's anger in Los Angeles and that one of the aides told him, "Don't be
surprised if the old man doesn't suddenly get up and go home." He said the
security of Khrushchev was badly handled and that Roswell Garst, Coon Rapids,
Iowa, the millionaire farmer, is no more than a publicity seeker and is a real
"corn ball."

He said one amusing thing happened in San Francisco. At about
7:15 in the morning Khrushchev decided to take a walk and, apparently, caught his
bodyguards flatfooted. He headed down the street with the guards streaming out
the doors behind him, some of them buttoning their clothes as they ran.

Jaffe is trying to get back to Russia (CBS lost their correspondents
after the television show that was critical of Stalin, et al.) and he has been working
with people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back
and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and that
he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is a second secretary in the embassy
and attached to the Cultural Section. He said that at the reception at the embassy
on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions and he would see
what they could do about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev.

Jaffe said that he felt that the over-all trip by Khrushchev would be
beneficial, particularly in case of a hot war because Khrushchev, having seen the
country and the people, may hesitate before "pushing the button."

This morning Kemper took a call from Mr. Sam Jaffe,
CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.
He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director
in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in
New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm
policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly,
the Director could not comply with this request.

Jaffe then wanted to know if it would be possible to
interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but
that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer
to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad
national picture.

Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting
the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable.
Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's
call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be
alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York.

Re NY let 7/27/59:

a. Residence and Employment

No change.

b. Current Membership in Subversive Organizations

Not applicable.

c. Summary of Information Furnished During

Pertinent Period

Informant has continued to associate with numerous
Soviet and Satellite Nationals in NYC in connection with his
employment as a news reporter with the Columbia Broadcasting
System (CBS). He has had lunch with them, has attended
social affairs at their UN Delegations and at the UN and in
connection with his employment as a news reporter he has
been in touch with members of the Soviet Bolshoi Ballet
while it was in NY. He was also in contact with members of
the Soviet Fair Committee while they were in NY in connection
with the Soviet Exhibition of Science, Culture and Technology,
which was exhibited at the NY Coliseum.

During his contacts with Soviet and Satellite
Nationals informant has learned information about individuals,
Soviet and Satellite personalities, which he has passed on to
the Bureau. He has been able to ascertain some information
with respect to the travel of these individuals and in some
cases has been able to ascertain the reason for the return to
Russia of some Soviet Nationals.

NW 88326 Docld:32989704 Page 8

NY 134-3315

Informant is occasionally able to furnish the
identity of an individual in contact with a Soviet or
Satellite National and can sometimes furnish the identity
of individuals in attendance at social functions given by
Soviet or Satellite UN representatives.

Much of the information furnished by informant
would not come to the attention of the Bureau were it not
for informant.

d. Amount Paid for Services and Expenses by Month

g. Information Furnished of Unusual Value

On 11/6/58, the informant furnished information
with respect to the conduct of VLADIMIR P. SUSLOV at a
reception at the Czechoslovak UN Delegation, on 10/10/58.
The informant advised that SUSLOV became quite intoxicated
during this reception, and while intoxicated became amorous
with two females present, one of whom is Secretary to the
Pakhistan Ambassador to the UN. Subsequent to this interview,
informant was able to ascertain this female's name as BERTHA
SAUNDERS.

NW 88326 Docld:32989704 Page 9

NY 134-3315

On 11/6/58, informant advised that during
lunch which he had with VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY,
BARKOVSKY asked informant to consider writing his analysis
of the American political situation for BARKOVSKY, and
BARKOVSKY told him that he would be paid for doing this.

On 12/10/58, informant advised that BARKOVSKY,
with whom he was in contact on 12/5/58, showed an interest
on that date in having informant ascertain through his
father, the identity of business concerns on the West
Coast of the US that feel trade with China would be
advantageous.

Informant has furnished voluminous information
concerning Soviet and satellite personel with whom he is
acquainted, which would not have come to the Bureau's
attention were it not for informant.

On 9/12/58, informant mentioned that the
CBS monitors police and Fire Department radio transmissions,
and has occasionally monitored FBI radio transmissions for
the purpose of obtaining possible leads for news stories.
He said that FBI transmissions have never been monitored
successfully as far as such leads are concerned, and in
view of the unproductiveness of this, FBI transmissions are
monitored very infrequently.

h. Approximate Number of Persons on Whom Informant
Furnished Coverage and Their Importance

Approximately 28 individuals connected with the
UN or Delegates to the UN. Included among these individuals
are the following known intelligence agents:

VADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY - Soviet

BORIS N. IVANOV - Soviet

VALDIMIR N. KRESTYANOV - Soviet

NIKOLAI S. KALININ - Soviet

IMRE HOLLAI - Hungarian

i. Informant's Potential for Advancement

Informant is in a good position to continually

meet additional Soviet and satellite personnel, thereby

increasing his value to the Bureau.

j. Stability and Reliability

Information furnished by informant has been found

to be reliable. Much of this information has been substantiated

by other live sources who have, on occasion, furnished the

same information as informant, or who have furnished information

with respect to informant's contacts with individuals about

whom he has subsequently furnished information. Information

furnished by the informant with respect to movement of certain

individuals have proved reliable, based upon known activities

of these individuals.

Informant has shown no signs of instability;

however, informant does have personal problems involving

marital difficulties which have caused him great concern of

late. He has been separated from his wife since 1/30/59,

and in spite of his desire to effect a reconciliation, his

wife is not interested in this. No legal action has been

started by informant or his wife, at this time, however, a

divorce will probably be sought by informant's wife in the not

too distant future.

k. Indoctrination against Disclosure

The informant has been repeatedly reminded of

the necessity for keeping his relationship with the Bureau

in strictest confidence. Informant in turn has repeatedly

expressed utmost concern about the possibility that it

might become known that he was furnishing information to the

Bureau. Informant has said that if this became known, it

would jeopardize his career as a news reporter.

1. All Necessary Action Taken on Information
Furnished

All information furnished by informant has been
appropriately disseminated.

m. Miscellaneous

Informant is desirous of travelling to Red China as
a news reporter. In pursuit of this desire, he has
directed communications to the Red Chinese Ambassador in
London and made contacts with individuals who might assist him
in obtaining a visa to visit China. He has mentioned this
desire to Soviet nationals, and satellite nationals, and is
pursuing his efforts to obtain a visa through all possible
channels.

In recent conversations with VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY
informant has discussed the matter of CBS representation in
Russia. It is noted that in the not too distant past, a
CBS representative in Moscow was expelled, and CBS has not had
any representative there since. In conversations with
BARKOVSKY, BARKOVSKY has suggested to informant that informant
could travel to Russia as a tourist, and upon his return to
the US, use material obtained for CBS broadcasts. The
informant is pursuing the possibility of such a trip with
his superiors at CBS.

Informant is still reading the article concerning
the Bureau which appeared in the 10/18/58 issue of "The
Nation". This article was given to informant on 2/12/59. When
he completes this article, it is contemplated that informant's
comments will be obtained.

This Office will, in the future, consider the
informant to be a Security Informant, and he will be carried
on a Security Index card. Future communications in this matter will be
appropriately captioned.

at the Bar of the Delegates Lounge, at the UN, on 4/14/59. Accord-
ing to the informant, KALININ was seen with SAM JAFFE, a CBS News
Reporter.
advised that JAFFE and KALININ are very
friendly and the informant indicated he has seen these individuals
together on a number of occasions for long periods of time.
Informant advised he is not aware of the relationship
which exists between JAFFE and KALININ.
As the Bureau is aware, SAM JAFFE is a PSI of the NYO
and his identity must be protected.
Informant indicated that KALININ noticed him at the bar
in the Delegates Lounge and nodded in a friendly manner but did not
suggest that
join him and JAFFE.
In the opinion of the informant, KALININ has been a
great deal more cordial and friendly with
since the in-
formant approached the Soviet regarding the lack of intelligence
activities between them. The results of this approach are set
forth in referenced communication, dated 4/13/59.

Re NY let, 3/3/59.

Informant was interviewed on 3/25/59, at which
time he advised that his marital difficulties have not
been resolved and in recent conversations with his wife
she told him that she had been seeing another man while
married to him. Informant does not know the identity of this
other man and inspite of this he is still willing to reconcile
his differences with his wife in the interests of his
children. No legal action has been started by either informant
or his wife, Although informant has considered seeking
the advice of an attorney, he has not been able to effect
a reconciliation in a reasonable time.

Informant does not show any signs of instability
and to date he has proven to be reliable. However, he does
show some concern for his children and is obviously
upset over his marital difficulties. This office will
keep abreast of matters pertaining to difficulties between
informant and his wife and the Bureau will be kept advised.

NYlet to Bureau dated 2/16/59, reflects that the
informant was given a copy of the 10/18/58 issue of "The
Nation" on 2/12/59. This issue of this magazine contained an
article concerning the FBI, written by FRED J. COOK, in an
apparent effort to "smear" the Bureau. Informant has been
contacted on several occasions since he was given this
article to read and on both occasions he advised that he has not
been able to complete this article. He has always requested permission
to keep the article so that he might finish reading it.

Comments concerning the article will be solicited from
informant when he completes reading it and the Bureau will
be advised.

Re NY let, dated 2/16/59.

On 2/2/59, JAFFE was interviewed by SAS JOHN G.

WILLIS and EDWARD F. GAMBER. On the occasion of this

interview, JAFFE was furnished with a copy of the 10/18/58

issue of "The Nation", which contained an article about the

FBI. When JAFFE is next interviewed, his reactions to this

article will be obtained as well as any comments he might

make concerning the author or staff of "The Nation".

On 2/24/59, JAFFE advised that his marital

difficulties have not been resolved and his wife has not

instituted divorce proceedings as yet. He is still desirous

of affecting a reconciliation and is making every effort to

do this. He does not intend to make any effort to dissolve

his marriage. JAFFE said that his wife is emotionally

disturbed and in need of the services of a marriage

counselor. He said that her difficulties stem from a

childhood in which parental love and affection were lacking.

He is interested in seeking professional treatment for her

but could not obtain her cooperation.

This matter will be followed closely by this

office and the Bureau will be kept advised.

JAFFE has been assigned
to
facilitate the handling of information furnished by
him. Future communications in this matter will be captioned
accordingly.

JAFFE was interviewed on 2/12/59, by SAS JOHN F. MABEY
and EDWARD F. GAMBER. During this interview, JAFFE advised
that as of 1/30/59, he moved out of the apartment which
he and his family shared. He said that this move
was made at the request of his wife, who told him that she
no longer feels any affection for him. JAFFE stated that
his wife is emotionally immature and that his marital
difficulties do not stem from any other romantic
interest on the part of his wife or himself. JAFFE
sincerely hopes that he can effect a reconciliation and he
exhibits very sincere concern for the welfare of
his children.

According to JAFFE, his wife intends to obtain
a divorce, the grounds for which will probably be
incompatibility. He has not as yet sought legal counsel
and will not do so until such time as his wife makes
some overt move. He is still very hopeful of effecting
a reconciliation.

This matter will be closely followed and the
Bureau will be kept advised.

Re Bulet, 1/28/59

JAFFE was interviewed by SAS JOHN F. MABEY and
EDWARD F. GAMBER on 2/12/59. (JAFFE's identity should be
protected.) As usual, JAFFE was most pleasant and is
cooperative.

During the interview, JAFFE was casually asked
if he had read the article about the FBI in the 10/18/58
issue of "The Nation." The introduction of this topic
into the interview was very casual and the exact date of
the issue in which the article appeared was not actually
mentioned. JAFFE said that he did not read this article
nor had he heard about the article. Interviewing Agents then
told JAFFE that the article was written in an apparent effort
to "smear" the Bureau. The Agents commented that the Bureau
always welcomes constructive criticism, and upon receipt of
same, has always taken expeditious steps to make any
warranted changes in its operations. However, the article
appearing in "The Nation" contained no constructive criticism
and in fact, the criticism contained therein was based on
untruths, erroneous conclusions, and biased innuendoes.

JAFFE said that he would like very much to read
this article and asked who the author was. When the
name of FRED J. COOK was mentioned, it meant nothing to JAFFE,
but when JAFFE was told that COOK wrote for the "New York
World Telegram and Sun," he expressed amazement. Interviewing
Agents expressed idle interest in knowing whatever provoked
the writing and publication of such an article and this
evoked from JAFFE the comment that CAREY MC WILLIAMS,
editor of "The Nation," was undoubtedly the moving factor
behind such an article appearing in "The Nation." He
said that CAREY MC WILLIAMS is violently anti-Bureau,
was anti-"McCarthy", is anti-House Un-American Activities

Committee, anti-Secretary of State JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
and anti just about everything. He said that
MC WILLIAMS is a fanatical and extreme liberal.

JAFFE hastened to explain during this conversation
that he was never a staff employee of "The Nation"
but that he was employed by "The Nation" on a temporary
basis. He said that he has not had any contact with "The Nation"
or its employees or officials since he left his temporary
employment with this publication. However, when JAFFE
went to work at the Columbia Broadcasting System, where he
is now employed as a news reporter, he gave CAREY MC WILLIAMS
as a reference.

In a further discussion of "The Nation", JAFFE
said that "The Nation" was at one time published by FREIDA
KIRSHWAY, but that she now acts in an advisory capacity
to this publication. She sold the publication to an
individual named KERSTEIN, according to JAFFE, and
JAFFE believes that this individual is associated with
the Federated Department Stores in Boston, Mass.

It is JAFFE's belief that this man's resources provide
the sole source of financial backing for "The Nation."

"The Nation" lists as its publisher GEORGE G.
KERSTEIN.

file 100-998.

In connection with our interest in learning
who is behind the "smear campaign," highlighted by the
article appearing in the 10/18/58 issue of
"The Nation," this office is going to make a copy
of this issue available to JAFFE so that he can read it.
In this way, it is felt that further comments from JAFFE
concerning the article and the people behind "The Nation"
will be spontaneously brought forth in subsequent
interviews with him.

NY 134-3315

Inquiry concerning "The Nation" was made during an
interview with JAFFE which encompassed some casual
conversation, as well as inquiry concerning his association
with Soviet nationals. JAFFE's reaction to the casual
inquiry about "The Nation" was such that no possible
embarrassment to the Bureau can result. He is most
cooperative, and anxious to assist the Bureau.

The Bureau will be kept advised.

Reurlet dated January 15, 1959:

Authority granted to continue contacts with Jaffe
for development as a potential security informant. This
should be handled in accordance with Section 107, Manual of
Instructions.

The Bureau considers subject to be of interest to
the Soviets and has authorized continued contact with him
in view of his apparent potential as a source against the
Soviets, The Bureau has followed closely information furnished
by Jaffe and it appears he is progressing satisfactorily and
is in a logical position to furnish us information of interest
concerning our coverage of the Soviets. It is desired that
this phase of his development be carefully followed on a
continuing basis.

The Bureau has been alert to the potential value
that subject might have since the publication of the article
"The FBI" in the October 18, 1958, issue of "The Nation." In
view of subject's cooperation with the Bureau and his respect
for, interest in and appreciation of the confidential nature
of the Bureau's work, you are authorized to discreetly and
tactfully bring up the subject of "The Nation" in an early
contact with subject for the purpose of determining his
reaction to the above article. If Jaffe appears inclined to
discuss this article, you should guide the discussion in the
initial interview or subsequent contacts to ascertain who
on "The Nation" staff is behind the "smear campaign" high-
lighted by above article. Two experienced agents familiar
with press relations matters should handle interview when
"The Nation" is first brought up. Obviously, at least one
Agent must be one who has handled the development of Jaffe but
in view of possible ramifications Bureau desires both be
conversant with over-all need for good press relations.

Subject is Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) news
reporter. He has had extensive contact with Soviets in official capacity since 1951.
He traveled in Asia, including Red China, interviewed Red China's
Premier Chou-En-lai in 1955. He wrote five articles in "The Nation" from
1951-55. He was interviewed by Bureau Agents 1-3-56 at his request. He
participated in making a film for CBS in the New York Office in 1957.
He was cooperative. He was interviewed 9-12-58 after Bureau approval to
determine his attitude toward cooperation with Bureau concerning his
knowledge and contact of Soviets in New York. He has been contacted and
furnished significant information on seven occasions since that time.
In response to Bulets 11-21-58 and 12-2-58 authorizing continued
contact with Jaffe to further his development and alerting New York to
possibility of obtaining information from Jaffe concerning "The Nation,"
New York, by letter 1-15-59, has indicated that they believe that in view
of subject's cooperation and reaction to our contact with him, they should
discreetly and tactfully bring up the subject of "The Nation" in the
course of a conversation with Jaffe.
Subject is acquainted with four known Soviet-satellite
intelligence agents. He has furnished information concerning an additional
two Soviet officials. He is still interested in traveling to Red China
and in his contacts with the New York Office, he has indicated that he
