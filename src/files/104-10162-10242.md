CC CPSU Representative in Buenos Aires

REFS: A. BD-7782, 19 February 1971
B. HABA 22379, 17 September 1971
C. HABA 21362, 18 May 1970

2. Headquarters can provide no additional guidance on CC CPSU Representatives abroad other than that forwarded in Reference A.

3. According to Reference B, the Station has tentatively identified one of the Soviet diplomats in Buenos Aires as the CC CPSU Representative. Since this individual was not named in Reference B, a Headquarters review of the files of Soviets most likely to hold this position has been made and from the information currently available to us, Viktor Grigoryevich CHEKMAZOV (201-138117) appears to be this individual.

4. Although CHEKMAZOV's present and past duties do not fit all the criteria set forth in Reference A, there are certain indicators that he is the CC UPSU Representative. Little is known of CHEKMAZOV's tour in Cuba, where he was assigned as Second Secretary and Chief of the Consular Section from 1960 to 1963. Prior to that, however, CHEKMAZOV was a Consular Officer in Uruguay from 1954 to 1958. Among his reported duties there, the following could be considered as background leading to his suspected current position:
a) handled emigre and repatriation matters and was involved in activities requiring Spanish, which he and his wife speak reasonably well.
b) believed to be active in the Colony's MESTKOM, (which in general is social rather than political, although the political element is ever-present. MESTKOM Secretary is usually a Party activist who is responsible for making certain that no possible deviation from the Party line crops up in any MESTKOM discussions or activities.)

c) reportedly became angry with a colleague who refused to prepare a speech commemorating GORKIY's birthday.

d) wife supervised production of the Soviet publication, URSS.

4. In his current position as Counselor of Embassy, CHEKMAZOV enjoys apparent freedom of movement and is sufficiently high-ranking to be the CC CPSU Representative. In addition, no firm identification has ever been made of his affiliation with either the KGB or the GRU. Although the Station reported in BUENOS AIRES - 18575, 29 June 1971, that CHEKMAZOV was believed to be a "likely candidate for new KGB Resident", it would seem from information contained in Headquarters files that he is more likely the CC CPSU Representative. An excerpt from Reference C contains the following indicators:

During visits to the Soviet "Quinta" almost every week-end, CHEKMAZOV
a) lunched with the Ambassador,
b) spent long periods reading, seated outdoors under the trees and remained generally aloof from other Soviets,
c) was the only Soviet who addressed other Soviets as "Comrade", and
d) his wife was said to treat wives of lower-ranking personnel in a brusk and authoritarian manner.

While the indicators cited above are not conclusive in themselves in establishing that CHEKMAZOV is the CC CPEU Representative, they do point up the possibility that he might be acting in that capacity.

5. We shall be interested to learn the identity of the Station's tentative CC CPEU Representative selection. In addition, from our review of the files mentioned in Paragraph 2, it seems that the most likely candidate for KGB Resident in Buenos Aires is Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-236701), with either Steponas Pavlovich MAGATEIS (201-7804582) or Boris Ivanovich BOSHIN (201-847689) as Deputy Kun Resident.

We should also like to have the Station's thinking as to the identification of the KGB Resident and his Deputy.

Acting Chief of Station, Buenos Aires
SUBJECT: REDTOP AEKICK BIOGENESIS Surveillance of AEBOOR
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES (Alferyev)

1. Since his move to the Residence/Club in mid-1970, AEBOOR has appeared to withdraw from almost all overt activity. Rarely does he appear on BILOCULAR and his daily routine is a complete mystery. In order to determine his present status, the BIBAFFLES were directed to run a surveillance on AEBOOR from Monday, 6 September through Tuesday, 14 September 1971. During this period his wife was away on home leave, thus giving him the opportunity to pursue a different life if he were so inclined. His overt subordinate in the cultural field, 201-820310, had left PCS without a replacement. Presumably his cover activities would be multiplied. Despite all this, AEBOOR maintained a spartan routine which left no clue about his present interests, activities, or responsibilities.

2. Most mornings (including Saturday and Sunday), he drove or walked to the Embassy, often buying a paper on the way. Once inside he stayed until about 1300 hours when he returned to the Residence/Club. His lunch break was rarely longer than a half hour. He returned to the Embassy and stayed at least until 2000 hours, sometimes until 2200 hours. Upon leaving, he walked or drove directly to the Residence/Club and never came out again during the night.

3. AEBOOR's only deviations from this schedule were an occasional trip to a neighbourhood shop to buy cold-cuts; one excursion to a leather-goods store to look at suitcases;

one attendance at a MEKNIGHT Embassy function; two trips to Ezeiza airport; and, surprisingly enough, a Sunday afternoon tour with 201-873887 and his wife to take pictures along the river front and drink beer in a Costanera cafe. (During this last excursion, the known KGB officer drove the GRU chauffeur and his wife.) The first trip to the airport was made in the company of several other high-ranking Embassy officials to greet an important transiting delegation. (See HABA 22399.) On the second trip AEBOOR was accompanied by 201-128117 (suspect KGB resident) and 201-790164 (chauffeur). On arrival, AEBOOR and his companions went up to the Chek terrace to take photos of the Concorde as it landed for a two-day visit. They were joined by Mr. and Mrs. AELESION and 201-228494. Evidently, the KGB and the GRU groups went separately to photograph the same plane.

4. Twice during the period the BIBAFFLES felt that AEBOOR might have been checking for surveillance. Otherwise there were no incidents of note. Not once were the BIBAFFLES approached by local authorities with a request that they identify themselves.

5. In sum, we remain as much in the dark as before about AEBOOR. With every opportunity and reason in the world to lead a hectic pace, he spent the majority of his waking hours within the Embassy. During the days in question he received only one phone call even worth noting, one in connection with the Fischer-Petrosyan chess match scheduled for late September.

1. Attachment F to Reference was translated and given to BIBAFFLE transcribers for their use some months ago. Transmitted herewith are copies of the resulting assessment questionnaires on six official Soviets and three local Soviet Cultural Representation Employees. A breakdown on the transcribers and their products is as follows:

BIBAFFLE-30: Assessments on Mikhail Konstantinovich VRAGOV (201-820310); Yelena Fedorovna VRAGOVA; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-236701); Roza Alekseyevna ALFERYEVA; and local employees Constantino LOGVINIUK and Luis ORSETTI.

BIBAFFLE-33: Assessment of local employee Esteban SEMENIUK (201-860420).

BIBAFFLE-45: Assessment of VRAGOV and wife; of Sergey Iosifovich SOKOLOVSKIY (201-025485) and wife Aleksandra Vasilyevna; and of Constantin LOGVINIUK.

2. The material in the questionnaires simply reflects the transcribers' impressions and is not necessarily correct. BIBAFFLE-30 sees ALFERYEV as short and VRAGOV as greying; but ALFERYEV is tall and VRAGOV's hair is still completely sandy.
