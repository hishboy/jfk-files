U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter
of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materials
concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of information and materials in response to requests
contained in the above SSC letter.

The attention of the SSC is invited to FBI memorandum
dated November 11, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive
oral briefing furnished to Senator Church and selected members
of the SSC Staff by FBI personnel on November 5, 1975. This
briefing was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any
written information in response to SSC requests for communi-
cations documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member
of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).

Because of SSC insistence in requesting items to
establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership,
as set forth in referenced SSC letter, our New York office
was contacted for documents representing original recordings
from Bureau informants concerning Levison. As a result our
New York office provided the material which is now being
delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in
various FBI documents that Levison was a secret member of
the CPUSA.

SECRET
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

It is noted that referenced SSC letter requested un-
excised copies of the February 22, and June 12, 1962, communi-
cations from New York which appear to have been the "articulated
predicates for the 'cominfil' case." The SSC letter did not
identify captions of these communications; nor identify any
specific "cominfil case." Therefore, we were unable to locate
any pertinent documents bearing these dates in our Headquarters
files. At a meeting on November 12, 1975, between SSC Staff
Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence
Division of the FBI, it was agreed that the two documents
apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12,
1962, captioned "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; SM-C" and New York
letter dated August 21, 1962, captioned "Communist Infiltration
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; IS-C."

New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, is being
delivered with this memorandum among those documents received
from our New York office. Excisions in this document are
fewer than those made in a copy previously provided the SSC. A
copy bearing no or fewer excisions cannot be provided the SSC
for reasons made clear during the oral briefing of Senator
Church and selected SSC Staff members on November 5, 1975.

It is noted that New York letter dated August 21, 1962,
which is being delivered with this memorandum, is not believed
to have been previously provided the SSC.

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

ALL FBI INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/27/00 BY SP2 ALM/EHL

I want you to know how much I appreciated the
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other
day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you
that we will do everything possible to avoid jeopardizing
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific
items set forth in earlier document requests which would
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion
as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley
Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, USA."

Of course in the event that there is no particular document
in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to
the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know
so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that
context. Finally, of course, we still need unexcised copies
of the February 22 and June 12, 1962 communications from
New York which appear to have been the articulated predicates
for the "cominfil" case.

Once again, I want to thank you for your time and
I look forward to hearing from you further on this subject.

Sincerely,

Frank Church
Chairman

FROM : SA JAMES M. KIRBY (414)
SUBJECT: STANLEY LEVISON
IS-C

(SFIO)
SENSITIVE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE OPERATION

On 4/9/64, NY 694-S* made the following observations
with regard to the CP status of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for
many years (and never at any time differed with the Party with
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the
Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending
Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left"
of the Party. LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely
"tactical." He has never criticized the Party, except with
respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question. The
fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with
regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all
respects. The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly
relations with LEVISON as it was in the past.

(It should be noted that LEVISON never has been
officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever
criticized him for being opposed to the Party's general
principles. It further should be noted that according to
the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of
LEVISON to state that he is officially out of the Party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that
he does not continue to be a CP member. It should be noted
that it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING
movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly
repudiate the Party, which he has never done. It should be
further noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact
LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that
BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently
"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of
the Negro movement. The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet
have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON
has refused to confer with DAVIS. As NY 694-S* understands
the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,
and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.
Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to
expect that the other would make the first move in an effort
to establish contact. NY 694-S* believes that probably the
reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements
for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that
HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting
between LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 694-S* has never obtained any information re-
flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to
Marxism. Even though his present estrangement from the Party
might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,
there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is
no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he
contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial
hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him
and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,
"I would like very much to see you but I don't have the time
now. I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will be glad to
see you in six weeks."

LEVENSON implied that he was going to Ecuador but
LEM doesn't know why. There was no anger shown, and LEVENSON
will see LEM when he returns in six weeks.

On 6/13/63, NY 694-S* furnished the following
information to SA ALEXANDER C. BURLINSON:

On 6/12/63, LEMENT HARRIS, CPUSA Reserve Fund
functionary, told NY 694-S* that in a recent meeting with
STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following
information:

The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still
MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust"--now more than ever before.
This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY
LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER
KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant", the
Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the LEVISONS
and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING,
"These men are Party members; watch out for them."

MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon
hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after
the latter left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each
other. STANLEY LEVISON said to KING, at this time, "I
congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning.
You are a real Marxist-Leninist. This is how a true
Marxist-Leninist acts."

Everything that KING does he first discusses
with STANLEY LEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice whole-
heartedly. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's
local jurisdiction.

MARTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of newspaper
reporters whether he takes orders from "the Communists"
and also, whether he took "orders from STANLEY LEVISON.
KING's response was that he took orders only from God.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that
the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight

---

NY 100-136585

for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since they feel
that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing" attitude,
has lost prestige, they will no longer permit the Party
to dominate or control their activities in the MARTIN LUTHER
KING movement. They are severing themselves, financially
and in a disciplinary way, from the Party. The LEVISONS
and O'DELL are still Party members, but do not desire to be
openly "linked up" with the Party. Although they are "dis-
enchanted" with the Party, they are not quitting the Party.
With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will
act on their own initiative, and will not accept instructions
from the Party.

LEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,
still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.
BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"
with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. Whether or not
the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding
matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a
matter for them to decide. In view of LEVISON's statement
with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently
of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have
any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS and
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of
the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment
by the Party.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, is
referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL,
BEN DAVIS, JIM JACKSON and CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true,
genuine, Marxist-Leninist from the top of his head to the tips
of his toes." In the Party, the report is that MARTIN LUTHER
KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line.

NY 694-S* advised that he asked LEM HARRIS whether
or not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING was
a member of the CPUSA. LEM HARRIS replied that he did not
know.

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address
the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH,
negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the
matter, might have felt that KING's making a speech at the
aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the
AFL-CIO convention, and, as a result, received invitations
from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"
to address their respective unions. As the outstanding
champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful
political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons
of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General
ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need
KING, particularly in the South, where in cities like Atlanta
and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of
power, and where KING controls the negro vote.

JAMES HOFFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates
the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING
can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters
Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,
and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING is being
deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,
HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an
effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA. KING was
inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him
that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and
likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General would
never accede to such a request, particularly in the case of
HOFFA.

LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi-
cally hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,
Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a
KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture
which PREMINGER would direct. Although PREMINGER's offer was
"tempting," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING's
organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the
offer would lower the latters prestige. After convincing
KING of this fact, LEVISON personally telephoned to PREMINGER,
telling him that "the deal was off."

---

NY 100-136585

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL to know
is that "KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied
it (Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with it, but because
of his being a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse
it publicly."

GUS HALL, according to HARRIS, was "elated" to
receive LEVISON's report on LUTHER KING.
