12. The second incident involved a rather unstable American woman correspondent Subject had met in Brussels. He had become friendly with her there and had revealed to her his anti-Soviet sympathies. Her association with Subject in Brussels was well known to some other Americans, including the person who had introduced Subject to us. Sometime after Subject's return home we learned that this woman was also to be stationed in Moscow. Knowing that she would want to get in touch with Subject, we wrote him that she was coming and advised him to avoid her. Before he had received our letter she had arrived in Moscow and had already visited him. She told him that her friend, the man who had introduced us to Subject, had told her under no circumstances to phone or visit Subject. (The man who had warned her had feared that she would cause Subject to become suspect to the Soviet security authorities.) This incident upset his equilibrium, as he wrote to us, and although he said that he had taken notice of our questions to him, he did not reply to our letter.
