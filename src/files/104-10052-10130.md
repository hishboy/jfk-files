MEMORANDUM FOR: Lewan
DATE: 10 July 1963

SUBJECT: Meeting

1. An unarranged meeting was held with LITAMIL-9 at 1900 hours (17 July 1963). Barker had a meeting with AMSAIL-1 at the corner of Ejercito Nacional and Melchor Ocampo at 2100 hours, but was in place at 2103 when B drove past.

2. B then stopped by the corner of Gutenberg and hired a pay phone to make a call to A-1, but as B's car made the turn, A-1 stepped out of bed and said, in English, "Here I am." A-1 got in the car and drove away. The mystery was cleared and the head called home, who had probably be back in about half an hour. I was assumed by this time Barker had spoken with his wife, revealed his presence and explained his presence (with A-1).

3. I saw Barker pass by later (from the pay phone at Auto Hotel Thiers - usual point) and spotted the car pull up. Barker was dropped off at 2325 hours. The word that A-1 will be in the vicinity of the Dam Hotel where another scheduled meeting will be held in two weeks.

4. He reported additional developments:

(a) The celebration of the 26th of July will take place in Ciudad Madero.

(b) L-9 was invited to the celebration in the suburb of Tampico. The principal event will take place in the Covel (Drive-in). The rent will take place in a separate room. Rivera and Jacqua will bake place in the room.

(c) L-9 was introduced to the First Lady by (the) MARIOS.

(d) AFA also reported that the Cubans are in serious trouble obtaining actors/prints.

(e) APARICIO said that when he was in Prague he had trouble with the client and asked to be sent to some other European country or to Mexico. He was surprised at the suddenness of his transfer to Mexico.

(f) In answer to a question as to who should be the man to replace him among the Embassy staff, said (he) knew nothing about (JORGE) loyal to the Castro regime. (He) might be recruitable but would be a risky venture. (He) goes into San Juan de Letran often might be approachable there.

(g) Only two Cubans were invited to the French Ascension Ball/Dance on Bastille Day (14 July). APARICIO and (Ambassador). (Start with the French L is a close friend of the Attache to whom he referred and palled around with during the war. The French Attache at his age, did not participate in a superficial way and became clear that he would be leaning on him to buy the boat.

(h) (Ambassador) approved that on 17 July, APARICIO spoke with ATARICIO, the one in Ecuador on the board - another young, attractive dishwasher in the Embassy. He is supposed to go to Cuba as a gift for ADA (who is very busy working on the boat).

(i) ADA is having trouble obtaining acters/prints.

(j) Let the 26th of July celebration take place in the Covel (Drive-in). The principal event will take place in a separate room. Rivera and Jacqua will take place in the room.

(k) Both went to Melchor Ocampo today. Sansone had restrictions.

(c) B turned over to B (for return) a handbill published by the Escola Normal Rural de Santa Teresa Coahuila, dated 10 June 1963, explaining that schools invitation to Fidel Castro to act as sponsor of the 1950-1963 graduating class. Copy attached.

(l) B turned over a pornographic cartoon (for return) distributed by pro-Castro elements in Tampico. Copy not attached.

(m) Wilfredo of the Cuban Consulate, Tampico, reported that IL CALDERON has a sister residing in Reynosa, Temos, married to an American of Mexican descent, Luisa may go up to the border to visit her sister soon -- or her mother may make the trip details not clear.

5. L-9 reports that he is very well "in" with the new ambassador who seems to respect him highly, and regards him for his contacts. He is also getting along very nicely with his new boss, APARICIO. His information gathering method is still to keep his eyes and ears open and ask no questions; thus he often gets only fragments while questions or discreet elicitation might fill in detail. He is extremely wary lest he arouse any suspicion.

6. While he suggested B might want to toss a few stink bombs at the engraving exhibit on the 20th in Tampico and the subsequent celebration of the 26th in Ciudad Madero, he was also concerned lest any disruption might get him in trouble since he is the principal organizer of both affairs. He felt that the Mexican Government might think the disruption was engineered by the Castro Cubans, themselves, to throw suspicion off the anti-Castroites.

7. L-9 is really worried about his security and it will be wise to take every precaution to protect him. He loves to talk - quite a conversation. B needs constant encouragement, and shoring-up. He is shamelessly inclined to pat himself on the back quite often and wait for a further pat from his case officer (which B is always quick to add). This characteristic comes out in his conversation when he stops and says, "I did very well there didn't I?" or "That was a good still, didn't I?" or "I think my ideas on handling such-and-such are pretty clever, don't you?"

8. For the present it has been decided to keep holding meetings in B's car. B can always arrange at night a mobile pick up. The pick up point has been abandoned in favor of B starting at the corner of Indors and Melchor Ocampo at the prescribed hour, slowly up the street to Thiers and Octomborg, then, without forging, will work his way back down the opposite side of the street to Melchor Ocampo. B will cruise by in his car and make the pick up while L is walking. Other minor details will be worked out as the meeting continues.
