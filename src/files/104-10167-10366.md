FOREIGN MINISTERS OF CENTRAL AMERICA WHICH HAD BEEN DISCUSSED
WHEN HE (MIRO) WAS IN THE AREA IN JUNE. THERE WERE APPARENTLY
REASONS FOR VARONA'S TRIP OTHER THAN THE OSTENSIBLE ONES STATED
BY MIRO. THERE ARE RUMORS THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE CUBAN EXILE
COMMUNITY IN MIAMI ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO OBTAIN HELP IN
CONVINCING PRESIDENT CHIARI TO PERMIT THE ESTABLISHMENT IN
PANAMA OF A CUBAN GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE HEADED BY DR. MIRO CARDONA.
