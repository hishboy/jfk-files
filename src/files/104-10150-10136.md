Introduction

The judgment of NOSENKO's bona fides entailed the
distillation of the huge volume of counterintelligence
information assembled in connection with his case, including
the product of his lengthy interrogations, the analysis of
KGB operations which he related, the results of file checks
of thousands of individuals involved, comparison of his
assertions against collateral information from all sources
and with counterintelligence records on the KGB and related
matters. The examination herein reduces this volume of
material to manageable proportions, to essential elements
of NOSENKO's claims, in order to permit comparison of his
statements with matters of known fact and to permit appli-
cation of reasonable judgment. Conclusions are drawn from
the examination of each major period in his claimed
biography. The final conclusions represent the aggregate
of conclusions independently drawn from the examination of
each major period in his claimed biography.

Summary of Case

The NOSENKO case opened on 5 June 1962 in the corridors
of the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations
Disarmament Conference. A Soviet official approached an
American diplomat with the suggestion that they get together
for a talk the following day. The diplomat advised CIA of
the appointment, explaining that he thought the approach so
unusual that it might be an offer of cooperation or defection.
He said he believed the Soviet to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,
a member of the Soviet Disarmament Delegation.

Later meeting with the American diplomat, the Soviet
official identified himself as NOSENKO and stated he was
KGB counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure the
security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that the American
had previously served in Moscow and erroneously believed that
he was the "American Rezident" in Geneva. NOSENKO stated
that he needed approximately 900 Swiss francs immediately to
cover KGB operational funds which he had squandered on
liquor and a prostitute in Geneva. He offered for this amount
to sell two items of information to American Intelligence.
These were the identity of a former American Embassy employee
in Moscow who was a KGB agent "near ciphers" in the Washington
area, and the identity of a Soviet in Moscow who, although
ostensibly a CIA agent, was actually controlled by the KGB.
In reply, the American explained that he was not an intelli-
gence officer, but that he could place NOSENKO in contact
with an appropriate U.S. official in Geneva later that same
day.

That evening NOSENKO was met by a CIA officer and a three-
hour meeting followed at a CIA safehouse in Geneva. Describing
himself as a KGB major experienced in operations against the
American Embassy in Moscow and against tourists and other
travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA officer
of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer to sell

(Summary of Case)

the two items of information. He said that the need for money
was his immediate motive for contacting CIA, although in the
ensuing discussion he also expressed dissatisfaction with the
Communist regime in the Soviet Union.

NOSENKO met CIA representatives four more times in Geneva
in June 1962. With the second meeting on 11 June, his earlier
expressed reservations disappeared almost entirely. He
answered most questions put to him on KGB organization and
operations. His knowledgeability was almost exclusively
limited to the KGB Second Chief Directorate (responsible for
counterintelligence and security within the USSR). NOSENKO
seemed to be what he claimed to be: a KGB officer in a
sensitive position with knowledge of important KGB operations.

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised
to do everything within certain limits to collect information
on matters indicated to be of interest to CIA. The only
restrictions he placed on his cooperation were his absolute
refusal to permit operational contact with him inside the
USSR and his request that no mention of his collaboration be
communicated to the American Embassy in Moscow. He promised
to notify CIA via an accommodation address when he came to
the West again.

NOSENKO again accompanied the Soviet delegation to the
Disarmament Conference in Geneva in January 1964. Since last
meeting with CIA he had been promoted to the rank of lieu-
tenant colonel and had become the Deputy Chief of the largest
department in the Second Chief Directorate. At the first
of the new series of meetings on 23 January he announced
that he had decided to defect to the United States. He
cited as reasons his continuing dissatisfaction with the
Soviet regime and the fact that he probably would have no
further opportunities to travel to the West in the foresee-
able future. Although he implied that he wanted to defect
as soon as possible, he agreed to remain in place in Geneva
while arrangements for his reception were being made in
Washington. NOSENKO had brought a large amount of new
information, much of it in scribbled notes, on KGB opera-
tional activity which he had collected in the 18 months
since his last meeting with CIA.

Top Secret

(Summary of Case)

On 4 February, four days before the date tentatively
selected for NOSENKO's defection, he reported that he had
received a cable from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate
return to Moscow to participate in a KGB conference on
foreign tourism to the Soviet Union. That night exfiltration
plans were implemented and NOSENKO was driven across the
border to Germany where his debriefing was resumed in a
Frankfurt safehouse. The decision was reached on 11 February
to bring NOSENKO to the United States, and in the early
evening of 12 February he and his CIA escorts arrived in
Washington via commercial aircraft, thence to a safehouse
in the Washington area.

At the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments,
NOSENKO met on 14 February with representatives of their
respective Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service. He told both that
he had defected on his own free will after careful consider-
ation and that he had no desire to return to the Soviet
Union. In answer to the questions of the Soviet represen-
tatives, he orally renounced his status and rights as a
citizen of the USSR.

CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on
18 February, and on 24 February he was introduced to
representatives of the FBI for questioning. At about the
same time, there was a marked change in NOSENKO's comport-
ment. While outwardly cooperative during most debriefing
sessions, it became increasingly difficult to get him to
respond to specific questioning. His free time in Washington
and nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude
behavior, and disputes with his security escort. He explained
his behavior by saying that he was under great tension as
a result of his defection, abandonment of his wife and
children, and the disgrace that he had brought to his family
name, and on this basis CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for
a vacation. On 12 March, NOSENKO left Washington with a
CIA case officer and two CIA security guards for a two-week
visit to Hawaii. There his behavior deterioriated still
further. He drank heavily and almost constantly; he
consorted with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude
in public places; and he spent money extravagantly and
conspicuously.

Top Secret

(Summary of Case)

During NOSENKO's absence from Washington, consultations
were held with the FBI regarding steps to be taken to restrict
his movements and activities. This Agency was concerned
that his behavior would attract undesirable attention and
publicity, perhaps police arrest, and that doubts about his
bona fides, which were becoming known to a widening group
in the U.S. Government, might be inadvertently revealed to
NOSENKO himself. The FBI on 1 April indicated it would
"not interpose objection" to the CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's
freedom of movement, and the Acting Attorney General, the
Department of State, and the White House were advised.

On 4 April NOSENKO was driven to a new safehouse in a
Washington suburb, and told that this safehouse thenceforward
would be his regular place of residence. Since that time
NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.

Intensive interrogation of NOSENKO, including a polygraphic
examination, was begun on 4 April 1964 in order to obtain
information which he had been reluctant to divulge earlier,
and to clarify contradictions in what he had already reported.
The polygraph examination results were inconclusive. This
phase of the interrogations was terminated on 24 April 1964.

Despite the searching nature of the questions and the
implicitly and explicitly expressed doubts of his veracity,
NOSENKO asserted that he was willing to answer, or to try to
answer all questions put to him. Because more information
pertinent to the question of his bona fides was needed, a
new series of interrogations was begun in mid-May 1964.
Different interrogators were introduced and questioning was
resumed in a neutral, non-hostile manner. The period of
neutral questioning continued until mid-November 1964.

After further consultations with the FBI, a round of
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. Between
then and 5 March, NOSENKO was questioned for a total of
about 140 hours by individual interrogators and interrogation
teams, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous
assertions. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements
had been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions

0001278
Top Secret
TS No. 197124

Top Secret

(Summary of Case)
in his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had
been basically truthful, and that he had come to the United
States solely for the reasons he had originally given.
These interrogations were suspended on 5 March 1965.

Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of
1964 and the interrogations of January and February 1965
concentrated on the period of his claimed service in the
American Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB
Second Chief Directorate, from January 1960 to January 1962.
Among the reasons for selecting this particular period were
the comparatively large amount of collateral information
available against which NOSENKO's statements could be checked;
the importance of the Embassy and its personnel as critical
KGB Second Chief Directorate targets; their importance from
the standpoint of American security; and the extent of
NOSENKO's claimed knowledge of the activities of the Embassy
Section, of which he claimed to have been Deputy Chief.

In keeping with a Soviet practice with which NOSENKO was
familiar, CIA asked NOSENKO in February 1965 to sign a series
of interrogation reports, so-called "protocols", most of
which concerned the period of his claimed service in the
American Department. These were written by the CIA interro-
gators, and they were designed to set forth NOSENKO's exact
statements and meaning on various specific subjects. The
protocols were in no way presented to NOSENKO as documentary
portions of a "confession", but rather as distilled and final
statements of what he did and did not know concerning
particular topics. NOSENKO was asked to read each page of
each protocol carefully and to sign his name at the bottom
to indicate that he understood and agreed with its contents;
he was allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to
ask any questions and make any changes that he wished.
(Amendments were entered by the interrogators and were
initialed by NOSENKO.) NOSENKO was asked, after reading
each page and after completing the entire protocol, whether
he understood what was written there and whether there were
any more changes he wished to make. He was then asked to
sign and date the statement, "I have read and understood
this report and certify it as correct", at the end of the
final page. With one exception, he did so calmly and without
objections. In one or two instances he remarked that his
statements were presented in such a manner as to make them

Top Secret
(Summary of Case)

look foolish, but he was not able to suggest any changes of
fact or presentation which would make them more accurate.

Commenting on the use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said
on 4 March 1965: "My life story is absolutely correct.
Anything I have signed is absolutely correct.
I absolutely
understand what I am doing when I am signing any paper.
This is an official document, and I fully understand what
I'm doing when I sign it as being absolutely correct."

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until
14 August 1965 with the participation of Petr DERYABIN, a
former KGB officer. These interrogations, held in Russian,
were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's KGB experience to
obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's claimed personal
and professional background.

During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was
questioned for seven days on specific aspects of selected
topics ranging from his identity to his involvement in and
knowledge of specific KGB operations. Questioning was in
both Russian and English. Although the interrogations
identified topics and time periods in NOSENKO's accounts
which contained the greatest number of contradictions and
discrepancies, neither the contradictions nor the discrep-
ancies could be resolved.

Because of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has
encountered among would-be defectors, the question of
NOSENKO's mental stability was a matter considered early
after his defection in Geneva. From his arrival in the
United States in 1964 NOSENKO has been under psychiatric
observation. A CIA psychiatrist and a CIA psychologist,
both with extensive experience with Soviet Bloc defectors,
monitored many of NOSENKO's interrogations. In May 1965
the psychologist for three weeks questioned NOSENKO on his
life from birth until 1953, when NOSENKO claimed he joined
the KGB, in an attempt to identify psychological factors
which might underlie NOSENKO's contradictory and inconsistent
accounts. The psychiatrist has continued his periodic
observations of NOSENKO to the present time.
and the psychologist concluded independently, on the basis
The psychiatrist
of their observations, that NOSENKO was mentally stable.

CHAPTER I

FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS

Evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides is comprised of his own
statements, the corroborating statements of Soviet officials,
and the counterintelligence information he has provided.

NOSENKO's Statements About Himself

In his meetings in 1962 and 1964 with CIA abroad and in
the course of the interrogations since, NOSENKO has made
numerous statements about himself. More than any other,
however, a statement written in July 1964 (after the initial
hostile interrogation was concluded) is a thoughtful and
well-expressed exposition of how he wished CIA to regard
him. It is quoted here in its entirety.

My life, my childhood and youth passed in very
comfortable circumstances since the position of
my father gave us the opportunity to live without
lacking for anything. And the only difficult
periods of my life before the death of my father
were at the naval schools attended in Kuybyshev,
Baku and Leningrad, and at the beginning of my
working life, when I was in the Far East in 1950-
1952. The opportunity to be always well-dressed,
to have a sufficient amount of money, to have my
own car, to be able to use the car given me by my
family and also my father's car, the opportunity
to travel to the South and to vacation in the best
sanitariums, dachas, and so forth; all this
unquestionably left its mark on me and became
something of a habit. After the death of my father,
my successful progress in my work gave me a higher
salary, and although I did not have all that which
I had while my father was alive, still I did not
experience any serious difficulties. But already
I wanted to live still better.

(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

Up to 1953, over the course of my entire life--at
school, in the Institute, at work, at home in the
family--it was always pounded into my head that
Stalin was a great genius, that he was good, keen,
etc., and the thought never occurred to me to
question his words or his deeds because everything
that he said, and everything he did, were completely
axiomatic. The arrests and trials only involved
traitors and it was considered and explained that
the betrayor of the people was Yezhow, the head of
the NKVD. Not even the shadow of doubt fell on the
name of Stalin. Soon after Stalin's death in 1953
I read a certain document given me by my father.
This was a secret letter of the Central Committee
of the CPSU on the case of the doctors; it was
not addressed to all communists but only to members
and candidate members of the Central Committee.
I was deeply shaken by this letter which described
in detail how these people, important specialists
in the field of medicine, were brought to such a
condition that they condemned themselves; that is,
they confessed to things which had never happened,
to things which they had never done. They were
simply forced to give the evidence which was needed
by the investigators. The secret letters on the
cult of Stalin and much that I heard in the KGB
about the reign of Stalin, all this left its mark
and forced me to think deeply about the real truth
and to look at everything more critically. I no
longer had faith in all those ideas which for years
had been pressed into my head.

The new leaders (Khrushchev and Company) used the
same methods but already diluted with the water of
democracy, with playing up to the people and attempts
to convince them that a new era would arise, a new
and better life,
