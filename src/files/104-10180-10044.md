Action: FYI

Following is a translation of a report submitted by AMMUG-1 concerning a shipment of explosives to Mexico:

"The Communist Party of El Salvador had asked me to send them twenty-five one-quarter pound packages of gelatin explosives. They requested that the explosives be sent to Mexico where they would recover them and take them to El Salvador.

"In view of the request, I spoke with Manuel PINEIRO regarding the shipment itself, as well as the amount. PINEIRO answered by telling me to do so.

"During my trip to Mexico (March 1964) I spoke with Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez regarding this shipment and he told me that there was no need of my sending the explosives to Mexico as this type of explosive was available in the Embassy. I then told RODRIGUEZ that I would answer the request from El Salvador.

"Upon returning to Cuba I spoke with PINEIRO, who told me not to send the explosives as the orders now were to send nothing but money due to the recent exposure of the arms shipment to Venezuela."

B. JANUARY 64 SUBJ ACCIDENTALLY MET LONGTIME FRIEND, ERNESTO AYZA DEL RISCO, DOB CA 38, SPANISH CIT. SUBJ FIRST DISCOVERED THAT AYZA INVOLVED WITH COMMUNISTS IN MARCH 63 WHILE SUBJ WAS VISITING PERU. AT THAT TIME A LIMA POLICEMAN WAS RUN OVER AND KILLED BY SECRETARY GENERAL OF PERUVIAN YOUNG COMMUNIST GROUP WHO WAS DRIVING CAR OWNED BY AYZA. AYZA SUGGESTED SUBJ NOT RETURN U.S. BUT GO CUBA INSTEAD AND INTRODUCED SUBJ TO RENTERIA WHO "WOULD ARRANGE EVERYTHING."

C. BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH, SUBJ SAW RENTERIA APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO WEEKS. AT EACH MEETING RENTERIA CLAIMED PLANS TO GO TO CUBA WERE PROGRESSING. DURING THIS PERIOD SUBJ THOUGHT RENTERIA "JUST MAKING TALK". HOWEVER IN MARCH RENTERIA ANNOUNCED PLANS COMPLETED, AND THEY READY TO GO. THEN INTRODUCED SUBJECT TO CASTRO LAVARELLO, SALOMON BOLO HIDALGO AND GENERAL PANDO.

AT THIS POINT IN INTERVIEW, SUBJECT VOLUNTEERED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON JORDAN: JORDAN IS G-2 OFFICER. SUBJ BELIEVES THAT JORDAN IS MAN IN CHARGE OF CUBAN PROGRAM TO TRAIN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONALS IN SUBVERSION AND GUERILLA WARFARE. SINCE SUBJ AT NO TIME IN CUBA WAS IN COMPANY OF OTHER THAN PERUVIANS, THIS IS LOGICAL MISUNDERSTANDING. SUBJ MET JORDAN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. HOWEVER JORDAN HELD SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS ONLY WITH RENTERIA WHO, DURING ENTIRE TIME AND ON ALL MATTERS, WAS CONSIDERED SUBJ SUPERVISOR AND HANDLER. SUBJ PAID OWN FARE FROM LIMA TO MEXICO.
