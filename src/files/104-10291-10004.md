MEMORANDUM FOR: James S. Woods

FROM : John N. McMahon

SUBJECT: Commendation for Exceptional Performance

1. The Directorate of Operations Records Review Task Force has finished its work in Warrenton. I want you to know that I realize that a large measure of the success of this effort was due to the exceptional performance of the Records Management Officers who worked long and hard during the six-month period, patiently guiding the 435 Directorate personnel who served on the component teams. Many of you performed additional duties, voluntarily and cheerfully, extending beyond the ten-hour work day, which kept the task force functioning smoothly.

2. This fine team effort and your personal contribution to it is in the best tradition of the Directorate of Operations. I commend you for a job well done.
