THIS NEW CONTRACT RESULTS FROM AN EARLIER SURVEY PERFORMED BY WACKENHUT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ALGERIA. THIS EARLIER WORK INVOLVED STUDY OF 40 FACILITIES AND LOCATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES, PIPELINE TERMINALS, PORTS, OIL AND GAS FIELDS, POWER PLANTS, LNG PLANTS, LPG PLANTS, AND OTHER CRITICAL PRODUCTION AREAS. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ENCOMPASSED THE FOLLOWING:

A. EVALUATION OF THE CRITICALITY AND VULNERABILITY OF THE SITES
B. SECURITY FORCES ORGANIZATION AND EQUIPMENT
C. SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS AND EQUIPMENT
D. MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND EQUIPMENT
E. INDUSTRIAL BURN AND TRAUMA HOSPITALS

COPY OF THIS FIRST SURVEY CAN PROBABLY BE ACQUIRED.

THE NEW CONTRACT, UNDER DISCUSSION, BUT ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE CONCLUDED, INVOLVES:

A. THE SERVICES OF NUMEROUS ON-SITE MANAGEMENT, TECHNICAL ADVISORY, AND TRAINING PERSONNEL.
B. THE IDENTIFICATION, EVALUATION, SELECTION AND PROCUREMENT OF DESIGNATED ITEMS OF SECURITY, SAFETY, FIRE PROTECTION AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT.
C. PROVIDING ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING PLANS FOR AN INDUSTRIAL BURN AND TRAUMA HOSPITAL, A FIRE DEPARTMENT, A SECURITY CONTROL CENTER, A SAFETY INSPECTION LABORATORY, A TRAINING INSTITUTE, AND AN EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE FACILITY; AND THE SUBSEQUENT CONSTRUCTION, EQUIPPING, AND OPERATION OF THESE FACILITIES.
D. PROVIDING DESIGN ENGINEERING PLANS FOR AN EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, AS WELL AS THE PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION, AND CHECK-OUT OF THE SYSTEM.
E. FURNISHING PRE-FABRICATED MODULAR STRUCTURES TO BE USED AS INTERIM FACILITIES FOR PERSONNEL LIVING QUARTERS AS WELL AS OFFICER AND OPERATIONS QUARTERS.

5. INTEGRAL TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS, IS EXTENSIVE STAFFING WITH ON-SITE US PERSONNEL WHO WILL OFTEN BE IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH SONATRACH OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS. A LONDON EXECUTIVE PLACEMENT COMPANY WILL HANDLE SOME STAFF SELECTION.

SUBJ: DCD CASE 65805 BRUCE BERKMANS
REF: MAINWARING/FRENCH TELECON OF 9 SEPTEMBER 1976, SAME SUBJECT

1. FOR THE RECORD, THE PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR BRUCE BERKMANS REQUEST THAT I SEE HIM WAS TO ENABLE HIM TO REFER A POSSIBLE APPLICANT FOR STAFF EMPLOYMENT TO THE AGENCY. WILL INFORMALLY RAISE THIS MATTER WITH THE PERSONNEL RECRUITER WHEN HE IS NEXT IN THE MIAMI FIELD OFFICE. BERKMANS HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS MATTER AND WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO PLAY THE ROLE OF A HELPFUL INDIVIDUAL.

2. HE ALSO REVIEWED SOME PROJECTS THAT HIS ORGANIZATION WILL BE INVOLVED IN BOTH LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. AS OF THIS DATE IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE MIGHT HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THESE MATTERS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO REPORTABLE INTEL OR OPERATIONAL MATERIALS.

3. BERKMANS ALSO DISCUSSED HIS COMPANY'S APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THIS MAY BE STILL ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY VOLUNTEER A USEFUL ITEM.

4. AS NOTED EARLIER, SINCE HIS DECISION TO REFRAIN FROM ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING THE AGENCY, HE SEEMS TOTALLY RELAXED. PERSONAL APPRAISAL NOW IS THAT HE WILL POSE NO PROBLEMS FOR US IN THE FUTURE DESPITE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF A FEW YEARS AGO.

REF: DCD/HEADQUARTERS 15734

1. I MET AGAIN ON 2 JULY 1976 WITH BRUCE BERKMANS IMMEDIATELY AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS ATTORNEY & CONSIDERABLE REFLECTION HE REITERATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME ON THE TELEPHONE THAT HE HAS DECIDED THAT HE WILL NOT SUE THE AGENCY OR ANY STAFFERS OR FORMER STAFFERS. HE ATTRIBUTES THIS DECISION TO WHAT HE CALLED THE INORDINATE COSTS IN BOTH TIME & MONEY. HE ALSO VOLUNTEERED HIS FEELING THAT THE AGENCY WAS BEING KICKED FROM EVERY SIDE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM.

2. BERKMANS WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE COMPOSED AND RELAXED AT THIS SECOND MEETING ALMOST AS IF HE WERE RELIEVED AT FINALLY HAVING COME TO A DECISION. HE THEN REPEATED WHAT APPEARS NOW TO BE A SINCERE OFFER TO ACT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND IN A NONOPERATIONAL CAPACITY AS A NORMAL DCD CONTACT. HE MENTIONED VOLUNTARILY THAT HE HAD SOUGHT AND OBTAINED THE CONSENT OF HIS BOSS GEORGE WACKENHUT IN THIS RESPECT.

3. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BERKMANS IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS FOREIGN PROJECTS WHICH COULD BE OF OPERATIONAL INTEREST TO US. I WAS, NONETHELESS, DELIBERATELY VAGUE AND NONCOMMITTAL WITH REGARD TO HIS OFFER. I AM, HOWEVER, LESS WARY OF SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP THAN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BASED PURELY ON OUR FIRST INTERVIEW. IN ANY EVENT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM BRUCE BERKMANS AGAIN. E2 IMPDET CL BY 011668

MEMORANDUM FOR: DCD/OSB
ATTENTION: Mr. Jon French
SUBJECT: Contact with Former Staff Agent

1. This will confirm our green line telephone conversation of 22 June 1976 concerning a recommendation that DCD contact Mr. Bruce Berckmans Jr (201-309117), a former staff agent under the LPGLOBE program. Mr. Berckmans recently telephoned an Agency staff officer with whom he is acquainted, indicating that he had information of interest and needed to talk with some one from the Agency. Mr. Berckmans is currently employed by the Wackenhut Corporation in the Miami area.

2. We discussed this case with Mr. Anthony Goldin, Assistant General Counsel/DDO, who felt that a representative of the Agency should meet with Mr. Berckmans to see what he had on his mind. Mr. Goldin said we would not be in violation of any Agency regulations or guidelines since Mr. Berckmans was the one requesting the meeting. Mr. Goldin recommended that contact be made through an overt employee (DCD) rather than through the LA/Miami Station.

3. Upon learning of your two immediate intel reports on 22 June, from private investigator sources, concerning plans for possible assassination of Caribbean leaders, we felt there may be a connection between these reports and Mr. Berckmans' information. It is for that reason that we suggested that DCD might want to move rapidly on this matter.

4. As mentioned on the green line, Mr. Berckmans' address is 3941 Midway St., Miami, Florida; his telephone number is (area code 305) 443-2260.

RYBAT RULE WEDISH

1. I MET BRUCE BERCKMANS AT HIS WACKENHUT OFFICE THIS MORNING AS SCHEDULED. BERCKMANS BEGAN THE INTERVIEW BY REQUESTING THAT I READ A MULTIPAGE LETTER WHICH HE IS THINKING OF SENDING TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. IT IS A DETAILED STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES STEMMING FROM HIS FORCED RESIGNATION AND INDICATES THAT HE IS CONSIDERING A SUIT AGAINST THE AGENCY. HE HAS IN FACT RETAINED COUNCIL, APPARENTLY ANOTHER FORMER AGENCY STAFFER, BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET DECIDED WHETHER TO PROCEED WITH LEGAL ACTION. OTHER ELEMENTS SHOULD PROBABLY BE INFORMED.

2. THE PRECEDING NOT WITHSTANDING, BERCKMANS, WHO IS FOND OF SAYING THAT HE RESIGNED FROM THE AGENCY BUT NOT FROM THE UNITED STATES, OFFERED TO SERVE AS A FAIRLY TYPICAL DCD CONTACT WITH RESPECT TO THE INFORMATION INVOLVED IN HIS REGULAR WACKENHUT DUTIES. BERCKMANS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS MANY USEFUL CONTACTS ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA AND SOON IN THE MIDDLE EAST. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS MIGHT BE A USEFUL INFORMATIONAL RELATIONSHIP.

3. I TOLD BERCKMANS, HOWEVER, THAT IN VIEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 1 ABOVE, I FELT IT INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO MAINTAIN ANY SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIP AT THIS TIME. SHOULD HE DECIDE NOT TO PROCEED WITH HIS SUIT AND OTHER THINGS FALL INTO PLACE, PERHAPS A FUTURE USEFUL CONTACT COULD BE ESTABLISHED.

4. IN DESCRIBING HIS DUTIES BERCKMANS DID DROP ONE MINOR PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL AGAINST THE CURRENT JAMAICAN SITUATION. THROUGH A SUBCONTRACTOR HIS COMPANY IS CONSIDERING A CONTRACT IN JAMAICA WHICH WOULD PROVIDE CUSTODIAL SERVICES FOR REVERE BAUXITE HOLDINGS WHICH THE COMPANY IS APPARENTLY PLANNING TO MOTHBALL.
