FILE NUMBER

1. On 26 July Rocca C/C/R+A called my attention to an aspect of information which must be thoroughly examined. When reading all the latest material pertaining to the OSWALD case, Rocca has the impression there are not only gaps in the record from the standpoint of what is known, but also some aspects which don't ring true.

2. Recently Rocca received from the British information about the activities of IRINA SHURAKOVA who has been in touch with a British controlled source (a good cleric) judged to be reliable. It is Rocca's impression (I have not examined this case thoroughly) that the Soviets have tried to make SHURAKOVA look clean i.e., that she has never had a KGB role and is only an Intourist interpreter to support their thesis. This is surface information. At any rate the [controlled British] source visited House Tussia's Wax works museum where SHURAKOVA had a visible reaction when seeing OSWALD display, although this reaction was entirely innocent on the part of the source [+] i.e., it was not done deliberately. Such SHURAKOVA reaction indicated suspicion that this was a provocation.
