Mr. Ernest G. Maycrink
Dear Mr. Maycrink:

Effective 31 October 1960, all contracts, oral or written, by and between
you and the United States Government, as represented by the Contracting
Officer, are hereby terminated by mutual consent of the parties thereto, and
in lieu thereof the following agreement is substituted.

The United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer,
hereby contracts with you as an independent contractor for the submission of
certain information and related services of a confidential nature under the
following terms and conditions:

1. Compensation. In full consideration for the submission of such infor-
mation and service, you will receive from the Government, payable in such
an approved manner as you may direct in writing, the following:
(a) Basic compensation in an amount calculated at the rate of
$6000 per annum.
(b) Additional compensation in an amount calculated at the rate
of $3000 per annum for cost-of-living expenses (including
quarters), effective upon your arrival at and applicable only
to your contemplated permanent post of assignment overseas.
Quarters will not be furnished you nor will you accept quarters
provided by a cover facility without prior amendment of this
agreement.

2. Taxes. Monies paid you directly or guaranteed by the Government
under this paragraph constitute income for Federal tax purposes. You will
be advised as to the method to be followed in reporting and paying such taxes.
The method as well as the procedures used by this organization to imple-
ment its tax reporting responsibilities will be based primarily upon cover
and security requirements. You herein authorize this organization to with-
hold taxes on said income if it determines such requirements so necessitate.

3. Travel. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for travel and
transportation expenses to and from your permanent post of duty overseas
and for authorized operational travel. You may be entitled to per diem in
lieu of subsistence during such travel and, when authorized, while on
temporary duty away from your permanent post of assignment. All travel,
transportation and per diem provided for under this paragraph must be
properly authorized, and expenses incurred hereunder are subject to pay-
ment and accounting in substantial compliance with Government regulations.

4. Operational Expenses. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for
necessary operational expenses as specifically approved and financially limit-
ed by the Government. Such funds will be subject to payment and accounting
in substantial conformance with applicable Government regulations.

5. Repayment. It is recognized that your failure to account for or refund
any monies advanced you hereunder shall entitle the Government to withhold
the total amount of such indebtedness or any portion thereof from any monies
due you under the terms of this contract in such manner as it deems appro-
priate.

--- Page 6 ---

6. Negotiated Benefits. (a) (1) If, in the performance of activities under
this agreement, you incur an injury or illness which is not the result of your
gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intemperate act, the Government
will provide medical, surgical, hospital, transportation and disability bene-
fits in such amounts and under such conditions as the Government in its sole
discretion deems proper provided, however, that such benefits shall not
exceed a total of $5000 for the same injury or illness.

(2) If you die in the performance of activities
hereunder and your death is not the result of your gross negligence, will-
misconduct or intemperate act, the Government will pay the sum of $5000
to your beneficiary(ies) less any amount paid to you under sub-paragraph
above if such injury or illness resulted in your death, provided that said
beneficiary(ies) is acceptable to the Government at the time such payment
is to be made. An acceptable beneficiary hereunder is an individual to whom
payment by the U.S. Government can be made without conflicting with its
avowed principles and ideals.

(b) Outstanding performance by you under this
agreement and your fulfillment of obligations hereunder in an efficient man-
ner will result in the Government undertaking your resettlement in an area
mutually agreeable to both parties, to the extent deemed appropriate by the
United States Government.

7. Execution of Documents. If, in the performance of services under
this contract, you assume the custody of Government funds or take title of
record to property of any nature whatsoever and wherever situate, which
property has in fact been purchased with monies of the U.S. Government,
you hereby recognize and acknowledge the existence of a trust relationship,
either express or constructive, and you agree to execute whatever docu-
ments may be required by this organization to evidence this relationship.

8. Status. You are not an employee of the United States Government
under this agreement and are not entitled to any benefits normally incident
to an employee status.

9. Funding. If necessary to protect the security of this arrangement,
monies due you hereunder may be funded in other than a direct manner. It
is understood and agreed that any monies so funded constitute payment by
the Government in satisfaction of its obligations under this agreement.

10. Cover. (a) It is anticipated that you will undertake a cover venture
in the course of your performance under this agreement. Such venture must
be approved by the appropriate Government representative overseeing your
activities prior to its initiation. Any and all documents which you may
execute in the course of said cover venture are subordinate to this agree-
ment and any contradiction in terms which in any way amplify, extend or
restrict your rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be resolved by this
agreement which shall always be dominant.

(b) To provide capital for your approved cover venture the
Government will loan you $4000 to be secured by a non-interest bearing prom-
issory note, payable on demand. Said loan will be deposited to an account
in a foreign bank and a $3000 letter of credit will be issued you against the
deposit. The additional $1000 will be released from said account, after
approval by the Government representative overseeing your activities.

(c) You will submit to the Government quarterly income and
expense statements on the cover venture and copies of all tax returns filed
in connection therewith. Your cover accounts shall be kept separate and
distinct from the bank account into which your personal compensation pay-
ments are made.

(d) You herein agree that monies loaned you by the Government
shall be repaid from the profits of the cover venture, in amounts and at
periodic intervals to be established by the Government representative over-
seeing your activities. After said loan has been completely repaid and all
other obligations, such as local taxes, etc., have been made, you may retain
any further profit derived from said cover venture. However, it is clearly
understood and agreed that your primary obligation under this agreement is
the performance of Governmental activities.

11. Secrecy. All information related to this agreement conveyed through
instructions, this instrument, or otherwise, is secret and shall not be di-
vulged to any person, organization or government in any form or manner,
except as authorized by the undersigned Contracting Officer executing this
agreement. It is agreed that any revelation whatsoever of the above infor-
mation will constitute and be an immediate and final breach of this agree-
ment and will result in forfeiture by you of any and all benefits which may
then have accrued to you by reason of this agreement.

12. Instructions. During the term of this agreement, and in your
official cover capacity you herein agree to act in conformance with instruc-
tions, oral or written given you by authorized representatives of this orga-
nization.

13. Unauthorized Commitments. No promises or commitments per-
taining to rights, privileges or benefits other than those expressly stipulated
in writing in this agreement or any amendment thereto shall be binding on
this organization.

14. Term. This contract is effective as of 1 November 1960, and shall
continue thereafter for a period of two (2) years unless sooner terminated
by the Government either:
(a) By sixty (60) days' actual notice to you from the Government, or
(b) Without prior notice, in the event of a breach of this contract by
your violation of the security provisions hereof or by your otherwise
rendering yourself unavailable for acceptable service.

Subject to the availability of appropriations, this agreement may be extend-
ed upon notice from the Government. In the event of voluntary termination on
your part or termination for cause by the Government prior to the expirati-
on of this agreement or any renewal thereof, you will not be entitled to return
travel expenses to the United States. Termination or expiration of this agree-
ment will not release you from the obligation of any security oath you may
be required to take.
