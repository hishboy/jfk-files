BOOK MESSAGE

FROM ASCHAM

1. AS RESULT OF DEFEAT OF THE CUBAN OPERATION CONSIDERABLE COMMENT CONCERNING KUBARK NOW BEING MADE IN PRESS AND IN CONGRESS. MANY PROPOSALS ARE BEING AND WILL BE RAISED CONCERNING KUBARK AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THIS AREA OF ODYOKE. ACTUALLY MUCH MISINFORMATION GENERALLY REPORTED AND WHILE SOME PROPOSALS ARE FROM RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS, THERE ARE MANY DISTORTIONS OF ACTUAL SITUATION. DETAILS OF CUBAN OPERATION ARE SUFFICIENTLY COVERED IN DEPCIRTEL 1637 AND SUGGEST YOU OBTAIN THIS FOR YOUR INFO. IT IS MY VIEW THAT KUBARK ACQUITTED ITSELF WELL IN MOST RESPECTS, ALTHOUGH I PLAN TO PERMIT ALL RENTAL FALLS TO BE AVAILABLE. FULL REVIEW OF OPERATION AFTER REASONABLE PERIOD HAS ELAPSED. IN THE MEANTIME PRESIDENT HAS DIRECTED GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT ALL PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS IN AREA OF MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY, GUERRILLA AND ANTI-GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES WHICH FALL SHORT OF OUTRIGHT WAR. HE WILL GIVE SPECIAL ATTENTION TO LESSONS.
