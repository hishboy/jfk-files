Re Miami let 2/20/67.

In accordance with instructions concerning the handling of double agents, there are attached hereto the original and 9 copies of a letterhead memorandum. The letterhead memorandum has been classified "SECRET," in order to protect the identity of a double agent of continuing value to the U.S.

As set forth in referenced letter, DOLPHIN's principal requested him to furnish information on a monthly basis concerning anti-CASTRO activities in the U.S.

In view of this the Miami Office will have the informant prepare and the Miami Office will forward a letter containing the information set out in the attached letterhead memorandum. This information will be prepared in secret writing.

The Bureau is requested to advise whether or not DOLPHIN will be authorized to make the information available to his Cuban principal on April 7, 1967.

MAR 23 1967

The above code name has been assigned to a Cuban alien whose activities are being [directed] (S) against a Cuban intelligence service (S). He was requested by his Cuban principal to obtain information relating to anti-Castro activities in the United States.

Through his contacts with anti-Castro individuals in Miami, the following information was obtained:

A meeting of anti-Castro leaders was held recently at the home of Palayo Garcia. Manuel Fernandez, former Secretary of Labor in Cuba, acted as chairman, and the meeting was attended by former Castro officials, such as Manuel Urrutia, Manuel Ray, Felipe Pazos, Raul Chibas, Rufo Lopez Fresquet, Danilo Mesa, Elena Mederos, and Efreu Gonzalez.

At the meeting, Fernandez suggested that a committee be formed and efforts made to have the committee travel to Cuba for a conference with Cuban officials, in order to discuss the release of political prisoners. It was believed that the discussion concerning political prisoners could be expanded to include a discussion of differences between Cuba and the United States. Those in attendance agreed that such a discussion would be timely, inasmuch as it appears that Fidel Castro is not completely satisfied with Cuba's relations with the Soviet Union. If the discussion of the relations between Cuba and the United States should prove productive, such information
