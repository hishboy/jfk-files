MEMORANDUM

TO: Robert Blakey
FROM: Robert Lehner
DATE: July 19, 1977
RE: Applicant Peter G. Beeson

Mr. Beeson is an intelligent, articulate young man who evinced great interest in working with us. He has some knowledge of the King case and possesses an open mind as to its resolution. He has tried some Narcotic Conspiracy cases for the Justice Department and has filed appellate briefs. He would be a welcomed addition to our team.

His present salary is $20,000. He states as of March 15, 1978 he would expect to make $25,000 under a GS-13 rating and therefore requests $25,000 with us. He will be available to start with us in the next two weeks.

I recommend we take him.

Professor G. Robert Blakey
House Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Professor Blakey:

I am sending the resume which you requested, along with a suggested salary of $25,000, (in line with the level which I would automatically reach with the Justice Department in the relatively near future).

The litigation experience reflected on the resume is almost complete; it omits only a second case in Puerto Rico (conspiracy) currently in pre-trial stages, an Atlanta conspiracy case I am preparing to indict, and a brief just completed for an appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The job has provided me with a varied and respectable amount of litigation and appeal experience, in addition to the more routine matters (immunities, witness protections, indictment dismissals, Title III wiretap authorizations, solicitor general memos etc.) handled on a daily basis by the various sections within the Criminal Division.

The job which you have described obviously presents an exciting and unique opportunity. Further, I would consider it an honor to work with you on the investigation. I expect I would be able to start work with you within a month, or sooner, should an offer be extended. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Peter Beeson
