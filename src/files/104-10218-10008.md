1. A trace reply prepared for the FBI in November 1976 indicated that from 1956 until 1961 LEONOV was in Moscow during which time he was reported to have attended the KGB school from 1958 until 1960. From 1960 until 1961 LEONOV was at the Fifth Department of KGB Hqs. A statement was also included which said that during his tours in Mexico LEONOV was consistently active in clandestine support of Latin American revolutionary and subversive activities, particularly relating to Guatemala.

PDSTORAGE: As of 1976 LEONOV was Chief of Service No. 1 (Information) of KGB Headquarters First (Foreign Intelligence) Directorate in Moscow. LEONOV has been considered for at least two ambassadorial posts.

A statement that a reliable defector had identified LEONOV as a KGB officer was transmitted to the State Department in August 1966.

(NOTE: DERYABIN's identification in September 1964 was inconclusive but could have been misinterpreted.)

BIOGRAPHIC PROFILE
OF
NIKOLAY SERGEYEVICH LEONOV

1. Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV was born on 22 August 1928 in Almazovo, USSR (also reported as Ryazan, USSR.) LEONOV graduated at an unknown date from the Institute of Foreign Relations in Moscow. He was assigned as Interpreter and Secretary to the Ambassador at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City from May 1953 until 17 October 1956. On 31 July 1961 LEONOV returned to Mexico City as Third Secretary and Assistant Cultural Officer. He served in this capacity until his PCS departure in June 1964. LEONOV and his family went on home leave to the USSR from 21 April to 20 July 1963. During this leave LEONOV served as Fidel CASTRO's interpreter in the USSR in May 1963. LEONOV was assigned to Mexico City again on 10 October 1964 as Second Secretary and Press Attache at the Soviet Embassy. He departed PCS for the USSR on 22 December 1968. From April to July 1969 LEONOV served temporarily as representative of the Soviet News Agency "NOVOSTI" in Lima, Peru.

2. Additional travel information reflects that LEONOV served as interpreter for Soviet Vice Premier Anastas MIKOYAN on his trips to Mexico and Cuba in November 1959 and again in February 1960 when the Soviet Cultural and Technical Exposition was being held. LEONOV traveled to the Dutch West Indies and Trinidad in September 1962; his position and purpose of his trip are unknown.

trip are unknown. LEONOV was a delegate to the 31st Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City from 19 September to 10 October 1976. In late June 1977 LEONOV accompanied two other Soviet officials on a visit to Panama where they were scheduled to visit with Panamanian Government officials. The next day LEONOV traveled to Bogota, Colombia where he remained until 3 July 1977. On this date he departed for Frankfurt, West Germany, presumably enroute home to the USSR.

3. LEONOV and his wife, Valeriya Ivanovich, who was born 30 April 1928 in Ryazan, have a daughter, Irina Nikolayevna, who was born on 16 March 1962 in Mexico City. LEONOV reportedly speaks excellent Spanish, good English, some French and little German. He has been described as pleasant, outgoing, intelligent, shrewd, conscientious, and reliable. He has a sense of humor but displays a temper at times.

4. Based on his activities and associations in Mexico City during his tours of duty between May 1953 and December 1968 LEONOV is considered to be a staff officer of the KGB (Soviet Committee for State Security.)

1. UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF FILE ON BERNARDO LEMUS MENDOZA (201-0091575) FOR CLEARANCE PURPOSES, ONE DOCUMENT WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO STATION INDICATES THAT LEMUS WAS IN CONTACT WITH A KGB OFFICER WHILE IN MEXICO. ACCORDING TO MGGN=4035 DATED 2 DEC 66, INFORMATION TAKEN FROM CAPTURED PGT DOCUMENTS REVEALED THAT LEMUS, WHILE IN EXILE IN MEXICO FROM 1953-56, WAS A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF KNOWN KGB OFFICER NIKOLAY SERGEYEVICH LEONOV (201-0132139).

2. LEONOV WAS BORN 22 AUG 28 IN USSR. HE SERVED IN MEXICO FROM 1953-56 AS INTERPRETER/SECRETARY TO THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR (FYI: PER POSTORAGE FROM 56-01 HE ATTENDED KGS SCHOOL AND SERVED AT KGB HQS.) DURING 1961-64 LEONOV WAS THIRD SECRETARY, ASSISTANT CULTURAL OFFICER AT SOVIET EMBASSY, AND FROM 64-68 HE WAS SECOND SECRETARY AND PRESS ATTACHE. DURING HIS TOURS IN MEXICO, LEONOV WAS REPORTEDLY CONSISTENTLY ACTIVE IN THE SUPPORT OF LATIN AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO GUATEMALA. LAST KNOWN LOCATION OF LEONOV WAS TRIP TO BOGOTA FROM 27 JUNE TO 3 JULY 1977.
