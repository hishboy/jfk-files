RELEASE OF CIA INFORMATION

Remylet 10/11/63.

It is noted that CUBELA is a Cuban Government official whose desire to defect was made known by MM 761-S in June, 1962. (Thereafter, CIA apparently made contact with CUBELA in Europe through CARLOS TEPEDINO, 9819 64th Avenue, Rego Park, Queens, New York, a Cuban exile and long-time friend of MM 761-S, who frequently travels in Europe.

MM 761-S advised that on July 15, 1964, he was visited by CARLOS TEPEDINO, at which time he confided certain information concerning CUBELA. He cautioned the informant to say nothing concerning their conversation which would permit the information to reach CIA or any other source through which it might become public, inasmuch as to do so might result in the death of persons in Cuba, as well as TEPEDINO himself.

[TEPEDINO] thereupon confided that he has been acting as the contact man between CIA and CUBELA. CUBELA is also in contact with [the Cuban Ambassador in Paris named CARRILLO,] who reportedly is anti-CASTRO. [CARRILLO] has been assisting both CUBELA and [TEPEDINO.]

According to [TEPEDINO,] CUBELA has been constantly complaining to him that CIA refuses to furnish him with certain necessary equipment with which he could take some effective action in Cuba. According to [TEPEDINO,] CUBELA desires some sort of compact equipment with which he can possibly eliminate CASTRO; however, CIA keeps offering him only large, bulky, unserviceable material.

According to [TEPEDINO,] there is now under discussion some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO, in which CUBELA will figure. CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however, inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been brought up again for consideration. President JOHNSON allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it. If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime before the elections in November.

[TEPEDINO] told the informant he has not been able to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that CUBELA is supposed to participate, that it is to be accomplished by men in Cuba, and possibly someone from Europe.

The informant advised [TEPEDINO] did not specifically indicate how he had acquired this information; however, the informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had obtained it from CUBELA.

The above is for the information of the Bureau, and is not being submitted in form suitable for dissemination since both [TEPEDINO] and CUBELA are apparently of operational interest to CIA. Dissemination would also lead to the disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely, MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further details.
