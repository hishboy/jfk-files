On 1/6/65 [JOHN] DIMMER, Chief, Office of Special
Assistant (covert CIA), the Embassy, Bern confidentially
informed that he had learned that LANE was to speak in
Zurich, Switzerland, some time in the next two weeks on the
subject of OSWALD's innocence in the killing of President
KENNEDY. LANE's talk is allegedly to be sponsored by
HEINRICH BUCHBINDER, well known Swiss Trotskyite who is
prominent in the Swiss Movement Against Atomic Armament
(Schweizerische Bewegung gegen die Atomare Aufr√ºstung)
(SBGAA).

At DIMMER's request, he was furnished background
material concerning LANE. DIMMER stated that he would keep
this office informed of further developments in this matter.
