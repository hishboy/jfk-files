Dear Pete,

As you reach the end of your active career of Government service, I want to join your friends and colleagues in wishing you continued success and satisfaction in your retirement.

You have been privileged to face the challenge of important responsibilities during your more than twenty-five years of service to your country. The success with which you have met this challenge should be a source of lasting pride to you.

May I extend to you, personally and officially, my sincere appreciation for the important work you have done and my warmest hopes that you will find full enjoyment in the years ahead.

Sincerely,

Richard Helms

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Retirement - Tennent H. Bagley

1. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retirement will be recommended to the Director under the provisions of the CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject signed an application for retirement of his own volition in order to qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The liberalized criteria for such separations was established by the Agency to parallel similar actions under the Civil Service Retirement System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23, dated 10 December 1969.

2. Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply as a retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Tennent H. Bagley

SUBJECT: Involuntary Retirement Under the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. This will confirm a previous discussion with you concerning the problem of a surplus in your career service of on-duty strength in relation to new reduced ceiling and the consequent need to effect a reduction in personnel. At that time you indicated your willingness to assist your career service in reaching its reduced personnel ceiling by accepting involuntary retirement.

2. Accordingly, and in order to establish the necessary conditions for involuntary retirement under CIARDS, I have determined that you are surplus to the needs of your career service and will recommend your retirement to the Director, effective 30 June 1972.

3. I urge you to contact the Retirement Affairs Division, Office of Personnel, where every effort will be made to provide whatever information and assistance you may need in preparing for your proposed retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-17 - Mr. Tennent H. Bagley

1. It is recommended that Mr. Tennent H. Bagley be promoted to GS-17. He has been in grade as GS-16 since June 1965 and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SB Division.

2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in my fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a chance to see and talk with a very large number of officers under both official and non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. He is one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination, intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom the future of the Organization is going to depend, and I believe that the promotion is more than justified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Robert W. Sheay

Secretary

Clandestine Services

Career Service Board

SUBJECT: Mr. Tennent H. Bagley

Promotion to GS-17

1. Mr. Bagley was promoted to GS-16 on 6 June 1965.

At that time he was Chief, CI Group, SR Division. On

1 September 1965 he was appointed Deputy Division Chief,

SR Division. As his fitness reports attest, his perform-

ance in that position was outstanding and when in May 1966

the Soviet Bloc Division was created he was named Deputy

Division Chief of the new Division.

2. There is little that need be added to previous

fitness reports in my evaluation of Mr. Bagley's current

performance. It continues to be that of a dedicated and

gifted officer whose energies and extensive substantive

knowledge make a vital contribution to one of the top

priority programs of the Clandestine Services. Much more

important, in considering Mr. Bagley for promotion to the

next level of the supergrades, is his potential for addi-

tional growth and responsibility. He would be capable now

of taking charge of a field station, particularly one with

special opportunities for work against the Soviet Bloc and

the Chinese targets. With time (he is forty-one) he will

be capable of assuming the senior position in any division

or staff in the CS. He is clearly one of the outstanding

officers in our service.

SUBJECT: Tennent H. Bagley

Promotion to GS-16

1. Mr. Bagley is without question among the best

qualified of the senior officers in SR Division and is

also one of the most competent counterespionage officers in

the Clandestine Services as a whole. Few have had his prep-

aration or his experience in the Soviet Bloc aspects of

this field. After entering on duty in 1950 he was assigned

to the Vienna Station where for five years he worked directly

on operations against the Soviet intelligence elements con-

centrated there. When he returned to Headquarters, he

supervised the CE Section of the Polish Branch, EE Division

when a combination of defectors and penetrations of the

Polish services made this job one of the most demanding

of any in the Clandestine Services. In his next overseas

assignment in Switzerland, he evolved techniques of opera-

tional analysis of Soviet intelligence residencies which

form the backbone of the system we are using today. While

in this post he participated in an operation involving a

major penetration of the Polish intelligence service which

also had enormous significance for our efforts against the

Soviets. Just prior to his departure from Switzerland, he

handled one of the most complex and challenging Soviet CE

operations ever encountered by our service.

2. In 1962 he was appointed Chief of SR Division's

CE element. Under his direction the CE effort of the

Division took on entirely new dimensions. Because of Mr.

Bagley's marvelous combination of CS experience, substantive

knowledge and enthusiasm, the SR/CI Group has become one

of the most effective and highly motivated units in the

Division. The Group has developed a high level of sub-

stantive specialization which it applies to CS coverage

of the Soviet intelligence services throughout the world.

At the same time, a large percentage of the Group's best

officers have been committed full time to a special opera-

tion of great value and significance. The ability of

SR/CI to absorb this workload stems not only from Mr.

Bagley's capacity for professional guidance but his ef-

fectiveness in leading and inspiring those under him.

3. Mr. Bagley's record to date reveals a high degree

of specialization in counterespionage yet it would be mis-

leading indeed to conclude that his professional interests

and potential are confined to this field. His contribu-

tions to the broader problems of Soviet operations have

been invaluable particularly in the way in which he has

suggested new techniques for attacking the Soviet target

abroad.

4. I consider Mr. Bagley an outstanding officer to

whom the Clandestine Services will turn for the exercise of

still greater responsibilities in the future. He is
