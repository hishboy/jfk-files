Dear Joseph,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/
Clerical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April
through 19 May 1978.

I well recognize the complexities involved in the
comparative evaluation of 560 clerical careerists --
a task further complicated by this being only the second
year it has been undertaken. Your deliberations were
vital to the Directorate's determination to bring to this
group of valuable employees the advantages of the merit
system.

Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's
program of personnel assessment and management. Not
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but
recommendations for career development and training
were also extremely helpful.

I believe that your service on the Board broadened
and sharpened your own focus on personnel aspects of
Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent
in this endeavor could only have made you better aware
of our need for complete, careful and candidly written
appraisals of our employees.

Sincerely,

John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Staff

Board Regarding PDP

Having carefully reviewed all personnel files of GS-13
personnel, the FY 78 DO Personnel Evaluation Board recommended
that the following officer be identified in his division's
Personnel Development Plan (PDP). This individual was
selected because of his relatively high potential, in the
estimation of the Evaluation Board, for growth to positions
of leadership within the Agency.

SUBJECT : Quality Step Increase

1. My congratulations on the award to you of a
Quality Step Increase. This recognition of superior
sustained performance reflects great credit on you
and the job you have been doing.

2. I am confident that your future performance
will be of continuing high quality.

With personal best wishes,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

FROM : Wesley L. Laybourne
A/Chairman, DO Personnel Evaluation Boards
VIA : Chief, Career Management Staff
SUBJECT : Recommendation for Quality Step Increase
for Joseph S. Piccolo (CI)

1. Mr. Piccolo joined the Agency in 1957 and since then has served
12 years as a field-case officer in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil as well
as tours at Headquarters in LA Division and currently on the CI Staff. He
was promoted to GS-13 on 4 February 1973.

2. Mr. Piccolo has performed in a strong to outstanding manner
during the past year as described in his fitness report covering the period
October 1976 to September 1977. He was engaged during this period in a
number of CI projects, including "a sensitive, multi-level project which
has resulted in a neutralization of some Soviet espionage activity abroad."
He also was called upon to support CI activities requiring extensive travel
abroad in support of joint Agency and FBI objectives and "he executed these
assignments with a singular degree of professionalism." He recently also
organized and ran in Spanish a CI course for foreign liaison and the Station
involved described the effort "as an outstanding contribution." During the
previous fitness report period he participated in two CI surveys in Africa
and Latin America and because of this experience he was recently named
to head another CI survey to take place in Latin America in the future.

3. It is the view of the Fiscal Year 1978 GS-13 DO Personnel
Evaluation Board that Mr. Piccolo has performed in a sustained high
manner which exceeds the normal requirements of his position and that
this sustained high performance promises to continue. He is, therefore,
recommended for a Quality Step Increase.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Joseph S. Piccolo

SUBJECT : Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category
REFERENCE : Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade

1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category B/OS for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place-
ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and
career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro-
fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STUDY THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN
CASE CAREFULLY.

2. In general, you should consider the following;

a. Categories are sharply defined. Competition
is within categories, not between them. Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/OS.

b. A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.

c. A category change should not be initiated for
th period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow.

3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category.
Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the
Career Management Staff.

4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to
your Personnel Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

Liaison officials join station in extending appreciation
to Joseph Piccolo for his outstanding contribution to the
current task of moulding the KISLEUTHS into an effective
counterintelligence organization.

Their high degree of enthusiasm was matched only by the
professional way in which they prepared their instruction
material, the ingenuity of their delivery, and above all the
high impact that they had on the students and their superiors.

Wish to complement the above two colleagues for a job
well done and for having upheld in their own respective
fields the high standards and prestige of the Agency in our
eyes and in those of our liaison counterparts.

Request that a copy of this cable be placed in their
respective personnel files.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Career Management Staff

SUBJECT : Request for Change of Career Designation
to B/OS-Operational Specialist from B/0G-
Operational Generalist

1. It is requested that my career designation be changed
to B/OS-Operational Specialist fron that of B/OG-Operational
Generalist. It is believed that the career activities and
recent events described below clearly meet the criteria set
forth in the Career Service Personnel Evaluation System Hand-
book.

2. In July 1977, I changed my home base from Latin
America Division to the Counterintelligence Staff. This
change of home base was precipitated by the cancellation of a
planned overseas tour in Latin America which was scheduled to
begin in July 1977. The cancellation of the tour was caused
by State Department objections to my assignment because of
publicity accorded me by Philip Agee and Counterspy Magazine.

3. The following is a career summary noting Operational
Specialist related activities only:

January 1970 - Present CI staff

August 1973 - August 1975 Liaison Officer, Managua
Station, (Spanish language)

August 1972-June 1973 Liaison Officer, Rio de
Janeiro Base, for a Special
Project (Portuguese language)

February 1969-December 1969 Liaison Officer, Headquarters,
Latin America Division/Cuban
Operations (British [MI-6]
& U.S. Navy)

April 1968-January 1969 Liaison Officer, Managua
Station, (Spanish language)

August 1962-August 1965 Counterintelligence Section,
Headquarters, Latin America
Division, Cuban Task Force
exploiting two intelligence
service defectors (Spanish
language)
