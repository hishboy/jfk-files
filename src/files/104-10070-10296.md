FOLLOWING IS THE BACKGROUND OF THIS CASE. THERE IS A MAN BY THE
NAME OF WILLIAM J. ACON, PRESENTLY WORKING FOR ECA IN WASHINGTON WHO IS GOING
TO RESIGN FROM ECA AND COME WITH CIA, AND WILL GO OVERSEAS FOR OPC. HE IS
GOING TO LEAVE ECA SOMETIME AROUND THE END OF THIS MONTH, AND MUST HAVE SOME
EXPLANATION AS TO THE REASON FOR HIS RESIGNATION. THEREFORE, CPC WISHES
TO LOCATE SOME FIRM WHICH WILL BE WILLING TO BACKSTOP (ACON'S)
RESIGNATION, IN THE FORM OF SUPPOSEDLY HIRING ACON. ACON HAS BEEN A RESEARCH
ANALYST ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN ITALY, AND IT IS FELT THAT
PERHAPS, EMPLOYMENT WITH RIA WOULD BE A LOGICAL REASON TO
GIVE FOR RESIGNING FROM ECA. THE RIA COVER WILL NOT BE UTILIZED FOR (ACON'S)
COVER OVERSEAS. ABOUT ALL THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF RIA WOULD BE TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Backstopping of Cover by the Research Institute
of America

1. Pursuant to conversations between Mr. Rose and Mr. Engels of
CIA/OPC and Mr. Travis of 00/Contacts, an appointment was made for Mr.
Rose to see Mr. Leo Cherne, Executive Secretary of the Research Insti-
tute of America, 292 Madison Avenue, New York City, to explore the
willingness of Mr. Cherne to backstop the cover story of a proposed
agent in training. The appointment was made, and kept, for Wednesday
morning, 23 January 1952 in New York City in the presence of Mr. Clark
of the New York branch of the Contacts Division.

The proposed story of the agent in question, who had been employed on the economic research side of ECA specializing in Italy, was
that he wished to resign from ECA and take up an offer to be extended
to him in civilian employment. Since the Research Institute of America
seemed to fit in naturally with his background and activities in ECA,
Mr. Cherne was asked:

a. If he would backstop the agent's story that he was
quitting ECA to take employment with the Research Institute of
America during his three months period of training with CIA,
and

b. Whether he would in fact employ the agent and send
him as a representative of the Institute to Italy at the con-
clusion of his period of training.

Mr. Cherne replied that unfortunately the latter was impossible
inasmuch as his company did not send personnel overseas in any capacity.
As regards the immediate backstopping of the agent's story, however,
Mr. Cherne said that he would be happy to oblige for a period of train-
ing only, to wit, three months, after which other cover would have to
be sought. Mr. Cherne requested that he be furnished at an early date
with more complete information as to what was to be expected of him
in his role as a backstop and further stated that he would like to
meet the agent personally as soon as could be arranged. This has been
communicated to Mr. Engels, the case officer, who will oblige at the
earliest opportunity.

1. When Rose of OPC was in New York on 23 January 1952 to discuss

for the OPC man. The following information has been forwarded by OPC,
and is quoted below. Mr. Rose requests that you pass this information
on to Mr. Cherne.

19 May 1952

1. This will confirm Mr. Rose's verbal request that the
Contact Division/00 ask its Boston field office to arrange
appointments for Mr. Edward Rose of Cover Division, PLANS/OSO,
to see Mr. William A. Barron, Chairman of the Board, Gillette
Safety Razor Company, and Mr. John E. Toulmin, Senior Vice
President of the First National Bank of Boston, at their con-
venience on Wednesday May 21, 1952. The purpose of the visit
is to explore the willingness of these gentlemen to act as
ostensible donors of funds to support a current operation.

2. This will also confirm Mr. Rose's request that the
New York City field office of the Contact Division/00 arrange
an appointment for Mr. Rose to see Mr. Leo Cherne, President
of the Research Institute of America at Mr. Cherne's conven-
ience on Thursday May 22, 1952. Mr. Cherne, who has for some
time been backstopping the activities of an agent in this
country, has apparently expressed willingness to provide
cover for this agent abroad. The purpose of the interview is
to discuss more fully Mr. Cherne's proposal. Cover Division
would be happy to have an 00 field office representative
present to insure continuity.

3. As a result of the above requests, Mr. Barron found
to his regret that he was unable to cooperate with the Agency
at the present time. Mr. Toulmin, on the other hand, was
most cooperative. Mr. Cherne, unfortunately, was out of town.
The New York field office has been asked to try to arrange a
meeting with Mr. Cherne, as outlined above, for Wednesday
afternoon, June 4, 1952.

1. On Wednesday, June 4, 1952, an interview was arranged
by the Contact Division, 00, for Mr. Rose of the Cover Division,
PLANS/OSO with Mr. Leo Cherne, President of the Research
Institute of America. The meeting was held at 11:30 a.m. in
Mr. Cherne's office at 292 Madison Avenue, New York City, and
Mr. Rose was accompanied by Mr. Clark of the New York field
office of Contact Division 00.

2. Mr. Cherne, who is currently backstopping an operation
within the United States, had expressed the wish to be provided
with some form of letter indicating that the Agency was request-
ing his cooperation, and the purpose of the interview was to
inform Mr. Cherne that this was against Agency policy.

3. This information was accordingly conveyed by Mr. Clark
and Mr. Rose to Mr. Cherne who accepted it with good grace. In
reply to a question by Mr. Rose he indicated that this refusal
would in no way mitigate his desire to be of service to the
Agency.
