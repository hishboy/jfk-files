FROM:
SUBJECT: Case 64574 - USSR External Policy - Pugwash Conference, Munich, Germany, August 1977

1. Enclosed you will find a list of attendees (Enclosure A) to the Pugwash Conference held in Munich, Germany, in August, and a set of questions (Enclosure B) prepared by the ORPA analysts at our request. Since the original list of attendees contained only the last name and first initial of each US participant, we had to make some educated guesses as to the true identities of many of them. As a result, do not be surprised if some question why we felt they had attended. In many cases, however, there was no question as to the true identity of the source.

2. ORPA has been quite pleased with the reporting generated by their previous requirements. As a result, they have made an extra effort to write even more thought-provoking requirements. We feel that the enclosed questions are the best we have sent out to date.

3. Responsive reporting should cite the current CIEL, Objective Ala and KIQ 90. We look forward to receiving your responses.

The Aarca E. Norman Fund, Inc., New York, New York

Purposes and Activities: Interests include the improvement of inter-cultural and inter-racial relations; the protection of civil liberties; the prevention and treatment of emotional disturbances, etc.

Norman Fund channeled the following amounts of CIA money to CIA projects:

1961 - $15,000 to American Society for African Culture (AMSAC)

1962 - $10,000 to African-American Institute (AAI)

1963 - $15,000 to Pan American Foundation (PAF). (This represented a part of the total budget for PAF in 1963. Virtually all PAF funds in 1963 were used for grants to individual recipients of Agency operational interest. No domestic organizations received any of the funds.)

1964 - $10,000 to International Development Foundation (IDF)

Norman Fund gave its own money to the following CIA projects:

1962 - $7,500 to American Society for African Culture (AMSAC)

1962 - $3,000 to African Research Foundation

1962 - $3,100 to U.S. National Student Association (USNSA)

We hold copies of Schedule of Ordinary Grants of the Norman Fund for 1962 and 1963. These documents confirm the figures and the recipients cited in the Drew Pearson column. No CIA funds were given for other than the four grants listed above.

FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Alleged use of the Norman Foundation and the J.M. Kaplan Fund, Inc. to Pass Funds to Organizations Involving Mr. Leo Cherne

REFERENCE: New York Times Article of February 25, 1976 by Mr. John Crewdson, Same Subject

1. Reference reports that the President of the Norman Foundation, Mr. Frank Weil, said that he was approached by a "mysterious gentleman" from the CIA in 1953 or 1954 and asked to pass about $15,000 in Government funds to the International Rescue Committee of which Mr. Leo Cherne was then Chairman of the Board. CLS files reveal that the Norman Foundation (formerly the Aarca E. Norman Fund, Inc.) was never used to pass CIA funds to the International Rescue Committee as implied in Reference. Attached is the record of CIA funds passed through the A.E. Norman Fund, Inc. and bonafide grants made by the Fund to CIA projects. It is noted that in 1961, the Norman Fund passed $15,000 of CIA funds to the American Society for African Culture (AMSAC). Possibly Mr. Weil confused this funding for African activities with the International Rescue Committee.

2. It is true as reported in the article and sourced to an executive of the J.M. Kaplan Fund, Inc., that the Fund supported a single Agency 3/0-2 program in the 1950's. This program was the Institute of International Labor Research, Inc. (IILR), a Agency-controlled non-profit organization active in the Latin American labor field. CIA's use of the J.M. Kaplan Fund, Inc. to fund the IILR terminated in 1964 when use of the Kaplan Fund was exposed in Congressional hearings of the Fatman Committee on Tax-exempt Foundations. Files show that the Kaplan Fund, Inc. made in 1965 a bonafide grant to the International Rescue Committee for Czech refugees and relief. There is no evidence that funds were passed to the Kaplan Fund for any other purpose than support of the IILR.

3. Although there is no evidence that CIA ever directly or indirectly funded the International Rescue Committee or Freedom House, Mr. Cherne personally and through a firm, Research Institute of America, Inc., actively assisted the Agency in the past. A 303 agent, Joel A.

JFK MICROFILM FILE SUMMARY

SUMMARY: REEL 4, FOLDER(S) 3, CREATED 02/07/94 by ES

SUBJECT OF FOLDER: Abram Chayes

201 NUMBER, IF ANY

INCLUSIVE DATES OF FILE MATERIAL Undated THRU APRIL 1978

RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:

Neither the information or time frame is relevant. See Summary below.

REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION:

A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's application and the issuance of a visa. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:

Harvard Law School professor who attended a Pugwash Conference in Munich in 1977.

CIA/U. S. GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP:

None.
