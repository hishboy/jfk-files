ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED EXCEPT
WHERE SHOWN OTHERWISE.

Reference is made to your letter dated August 21, 1961, your reference CSCI-3/766()(u)

Preview of this Bureau's file on subject fails to prove that he wrote bank drafts to active communist workers with the possible exception of Alicia Merino Fuentes. With regard to her, the only allegation that she was an active communist worker was made in February, 1941, by a person whose reliability was unknown to the United States Embassy in Mexico City, D. F. Our investigation failed to substantiate this allegation and you were so advised by letter under above caption dated September 24, 1959. Furthermore, at the time subject's bank draft to her was written (February 10, 1958) subject and Merino Fuentes were both connected with the Mexican Mission to the United Nations, a fact which tends to reduce the intelligence significance of this payment.

Based on information in the files of this Bureau, it appears inadvisable to include in your summary to the Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BfV), Germany, that subject wrote bank drafts to active communist workers or to suggest that he "was used as a means of financing Communist Party activities."

NOTE: Top (u)
This letter is classified "Secret" because it contains information so classified by CIA.
CIA (22 (u)

CIA seeks to pass a summary of information concerning subject to the BfV in Germany and has requested permission to include the following in this summary stating it comes from our files:

"During his New York City tenure, he was known to write bank drafts to persons known to be active Communist workers. It was suggested that he was used as a means of financing Communist Party activities." ()(u)

CIA stated above conclusion "was apparently based on numerous Bureau reports written during 1957 and 1958." CIA refers specifically to only one bank draft, it having been written by subject to Alicia Merino Fuentes and states that our report dated 10/12/56 contained information that she was an active communist. This report was in the case on Merino Fuentes and the only allegation that she was an active communist was the 1941 allegation made to the Embassy in Mexico. Bureau has developed no information indicating payees of other bank drafts written by subject had subversive associations or sympathies.
