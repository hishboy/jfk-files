AGENCY FILE NUMBER:

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 2

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

MEMORANDUM

TO: TOM LAMBETH
FROM: KENNETH D. KLEIN
DATE: JUNE 14, 1977
RE: CLARENCE DAY - INVESTIGATOR

It is my recommendation that Clarence Day be hired as an investigator for the JFK Task Force. His resume is very impressive and his long career as a law enforcement officer certainly qualifies him to be an investigator for this Committee.

Equally important were his reactions to the questions I posed to him. He came across as an intelligent man who is well versed in the law as it applies to the rights of individuals, and he impressed me as a man who would be a valuable member of our task force.

APPROVED:
Robert K. Tanenbaum
