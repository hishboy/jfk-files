1.  Reference is made to our memorandum of 17 July 1961, captioned as above, and also to teletype letters dated 23 June 1961, addressed to the Director, National Security Agency, with copy to this Agency, Subject: Legars Ferguson MITCHELL, William Hardiway MARTI, ECEILIAN SCES - INFORMATION CONCERNING.

2.  The following information supplements the material re: Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU aka DAMASCUS, reported in paragraph 3 of our 17 July 1961 memorandum, referenced above.

3.  Our representatives in Melbourne advised that Australian Security Service indices reflect that Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCO, Greek national, born 10 March 1938 at Alexandria, Egypt, arrived in Sydney, Australia, for permanent residence on 26 October 1956, aboard the S.S. STRATHEDEN traveling on Greek Passport No. 8063/1961 issued 8 March 1961 at Alexandria, Egypt.

He was described as follows: single, 6 feet 10 inches tall, normal build, brown eyes, black hair, occupation "writer". He departed Australia on 25 May 1960 aboard the S.S. ORONSAY, destination not indicated, and as of 16 July 1961 had not re-entered Australia.

New York in connection with the visa of her possible for an entry permit, she made no mention of any wedding plans. The Mexican Government approved her trip on condition that she deposit with the Consulate a 16,000 Peso bond, as a guarantee of her intention to depart Mexico upon expiration of her tourist card. Mexican Security Police contain no record of her actual arrival in Mexico following approval of her 8 July 1960 application. The most recent correspondence on this case contained in Liaison files is dated 16 February 1961, reflecting that Anastasie DAMASCOU again requested a Tourist Card as of about the date of the letter, at which time her address in the United States was given as c/o Mexican Consul, San Antonio, Texas, in reply to her second application for an entry permit. Mexican authorities again replied with a request that she post a bond in the amount of 16,000 Pesos, to guarantee departure from Mexico upon expiration of her tourist visa. There is no further information currently available on her further travel plans.

With reference to Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU, on basis of the information reported in preceding paragraph, a recheck by our representatives with officials of the United States Embassy in Mexico City revealed that Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU, born 10 March 1938 at Alexandria, Egypt, holder of Greek Passport 149638 issued in Alexandria, Egypt, on 8 March 1961 and valid to 29 April 1963, with address of 8 Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, Australia, was the recipient of a United States Visa on 22 October 1960. On his application, DAMASCOU indicated that he desired to visit the United States for a period of four months, described as a pleasure trip to visit his sister. His visa application did not include any destination address in the United States. It was also reported that the visa card maintained on Nicolas DAMASKOU in the Embassy in Mexico City contains a notation 70683 to Immigration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles, May 19 1961.

6. Through a reliable confidential source our representative in Egypt had learned in the interim that Nicolas DAMASCOU, who is identical with the individual described in preceding paragraphs, currently resides in Los Angeles, California, at 1690 North Gardner, Apartment 18, and that he advised his mother and younger brother, still residing in Alexandria, that he has no plans to marry the daughter of an American official, who is not further identified. The same source also advised that Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU, father of Nicolas and Anastasis DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, died during the summer of 1960. Following the demise of the father, Angelika DAMASCOU aka SAVOURAS, widowed mother of Nicolas and Anastasio

DAMASCOU, in company of a younger son not identified by name had planned to emigrate from Egypt to join her son Nicolas in the United States. However, prior to the realization of these plans, Angelika DAMASCOU suffered a stroke, exact details concerning which are not known, but she is reported as of this writing still to be paralyzed and obviously is unable to travel. No further information was available on the possible future migration plans of Angelika DAMASCOU aka SAVOURAS and/or of the unidentified younger brother of Nicolas DAMASCOU and of Anastasie DAMASCOU.

On basis of the reported filing of an application for a United States Visa in July 1956 at the U.S. Embassy in London by Anastasis DAMASCOU, our representatives in London were requested to initiate a check of British liaison indices in the names of Nicolas DAMASCOU and of Anastasie DAMASCOU. MI-5 advised that as of late July 1961, they hold no traces on Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU aka DAMASCUS, but that although they had no traces on Anastasie DAMASCOU, they were continuing to check her possible residence in London during 1956, based on the reported visa application data. MI-5 advised that they hold no traces on either Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASKOU aka DAMASCUS or on the sister Anastasie Georges DAMASCOU.

3.  It is suggested that the indices of the Department of State, Visa Section as well as the indices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice, may contain further detailed information on the current immigration status, whereabouts in the United States, and also the contacts in the United States of Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS of Anastasis Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS and any other members of the family who may have applied for entry visas from abroad.

4.  With regard to Justo SIERRA Casares, mentioned in above telephoned memorandum of 17 July 1961 as a contact of Nicolas DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, it is suggested that the indices of the Department of State may contain additional information on his activities during his service at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C.
