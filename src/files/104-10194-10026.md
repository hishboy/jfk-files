Dear Dave:

I am happy to send to you, under separate cover,

tangible form of recognition and appreciation of your

reminder of an honorable career, rewarding associations
and the knowledge that you played your part in a vital
activity.

Let me, therefore, add my congratulations and wish
you the very best for the future.

Sincerely,

10 June 1975

Mr. David A. Phillips
8224 Stone Trail Drive
Bethesda, Maryland 20034

Dear Dave:

The ordinary retirement letter is in no way
appropriate for you. In the first place, your
retirement is no stepping out of the active world
into a world of pleasure. Instead, you are launch-
ing off on even a tougher challenge because of your
sense of dedication. Your retirement also will not
be the termination of your interest in intelligence
and in this Agency. Instead, you are going to be
doing what you can to help it surviva the current
set of attacks upon it. But most of all, your
retirement is the departure of one of our most
exceptional officers, to whom I had the great
pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal
and whose work I have admired these many years. The
only thing ordinary about your retirement is the
sincere and special personal and official good wishes
we in the Agency send to you and your family for
success and satisfaction in the years ahead. This
we send to all our retirees, and we send it to you
with special spirit.

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby
Director
