C/CFD

Attached is a draft of an amendment on TICHBORN. Note memo of request asks for an increase in basic fee from $12,000 to $17,000 based on TICHBORN's "overall performance and full time services". Additional memoranda in file reflect the following:

(1) 19 May 1961 contract (still in effect) provided a basic fee of $8000 with no mention of amount of time subject worked to earn such.

(2) WH memo of 18 June 63 asked a pay increase from $8000 to $9000 based upon, "manner of TICHBORN's performance and the increase amt. of time which he devotes to Agency requirements".

(3) A dispatch of 9 Nov 64 said that, "Hqs agrees that present expiring contract called for about 2/3rds subject's time---TICHBORN pointed out.... he now engaged 90% of his time for Agency".

(4) WH memo of 24 Nov 64 requested an increase from $9000 to $12,000 based upon TICHBORN's increased value plus "using TICHBORN's service on substantially a full time basis".

(5) As cited above, current WH memo of 7 Oct 66 asks for an increase of $5000 from $12,000 to $17,000 based on subject's "overall performance and full time services".

I pointed out the above chrono with respect to the ever increasing usage of subject's time to Renehan who apparently feels the last memo is OK unless CPD desires to make a formal objection and return it.

Paul

Note - Per C/CPD WH (Renehan) will submit a new memo to justify the current request.

Mr.

Dear Mr.

Reference is made to your current contract with the United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain Independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the 1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.

As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

"Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Government employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an employee-employer relationship, Your legal status under this agreement continues to be that of an independent contractor."

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this organization. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your covert deductions returned.

All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force and effect.

Effective 1 December 1964 the figure $9,000 is deleted from paragraph one (1) (a) and in lieu thereof the figure $12,000 is substituted.

b. Increase in basic compensation from $9,000 to $12,000 per annum effective 1 December 1964.

c. Extend period of contract for an additional one year.

2.

TOOK has agreed to fulfill the assignments including TDY assignments in other countries from time to time. In view of the level of the work involved and of TICHBORN's demonstrated ability, the basic recommendations are considered fully warranted.

EMPLOYEE'S WITHHOLDING EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE AND QUESTIONNAIRE

PRINT NAME (Pseudonym)
TICHBORN, Edward G.

WITHHOLDING EXEMPTIONS

INSTRUCTIONS

1. NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS. Do not claim more than the correct number of exemptions. However, if you expect to owe more income tax for the year than will be withheld if you claim every exemption to which you are entitled, you may increase the withholding by claiming a smaller number of exemptions.

2. CHANGES IN EXEMPTIONS. You may file a new certificate at any time if the number of your exemptions INCREASES. You must file a new certificate within 10 days if the number of exemptions previously claimed by you DECREASES for any of the following reasons:

(a) Your wife (or husband) for whom you have been claiming exemption is divorced or legally separated, or claims her (or his) own exemption on a separate certificate.

(b) The support of a dependent for whom you claimed exemption is taken over by someone else, so that you no longer expect to furnish more than half the support for the year.

(c) You find that a dependent for whom you claimed exemption will receive $600 or more of income of his own during the year (except your child who is a student or who is under 19 years of age).

OTHER DECREASES in exemption, such as the death of a wife or a dependent, do not affect your withholding until the next year, but require the filing of a new certificate by December 1 of the year in which they occur.

For further information about changes in exemption status resulting from marriage, divorce, legal separation, birth, death, new dependents, multiple-support agreements, old age, blindness, etc., consult your Local District Director of Internal Revenue or your employer.

3. DEPENDENTS. To qualify as your dependent (line 4 below), a person (a) must receive more than one-half of his or her support from you for the year, and (b) must have less than $600 gross income during the year (except your child who is a student or who is under 19 years of age), and (c) must not be claimed as an exemption by such person's husband or wife, and (d) must be a citizen or resident of the United States or a resident of Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Panama or the Canal Zone, and (e) must (1) have your home as his principal residence and be a member of your household for the entire year, or (2) be related to you as follows:

Your son or daughter (including legally adopted children), grandchild, stepson, stepdaughter, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law;

Your father, mother, grandparent, stepfather, stepmother, father-in-law, or mother-in-law;

Your brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law;

Your uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece (but only if related by blood).

4. PENALTIES. Penalties are imposed for willfully supplying false information or willful failure to supply information which would reduce the withholding exemption.

1. If SINGLE, and you claim an exemption, write the figure "1"
2. If MARRIED, one exemption each for husband and wife if not claimed on another certificate.

(a) If you claim both of these exemptions, write the figure "2"
(b) If you claim one of these exemptions, write the figure "1"
(c) If you claim neither of these exemptions, write "0"
