Memorandum

To: G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director
From: Robin Lindley

Date: November 24, 1978

Re: Request for Salary Increase

I would greatly appreciate a wage increase. As you are aware, my
responsibilities with the Committee have changed dramatically in the past
few months. Not only have I assisted with ad hoc writing projects such
as narrations and staff reports that have been used in public session
hearings, but I am also responsible for writing and editing a substan-
tial part of the final report of the King Task Force.

My background uniquely complements my present duties with the editori-
al staff. In support of this salary request, it may be useful to reac-
quaint you with my experience. Following my graduation from the Univer-
sity of Washington School of Law in 1974, I worked for two years as a
full-time Instructor of Law. In that capacity, I taught a legal research,
writing, and analysis course, and had the opportunity to critically examine
hundreds of pieces of student work. I also developed a seminar in writing
about law for persons without a legal background, an effort to encourage
students to humanize and demystify their own legal writing, as well as
review possible examples of this sort of writing, such as legal journalism.

In addition, I am familiar with historical research and writing. I received
my Bachelor of Arts degree in history (with distinction), with an em-
phasis in United States and modern European history, and while attending
law school, I organized and taught a course concerning the role of vio-
lence in American history that was presented in the Department of General
and Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Washington.

I have worked diligently for this Committee since October 1977. As a
research attorney, I did my best to research issues thoroughly and accurate-
ly, to analyze and cogently synthesize relevant material, and to present
the fruits of my efforts in a clear and concise manner. I also endeavored
to see that this information was used effectively in connection with the
King investigation, despite some obstacles posed by staff regimentation.
Furthermore, I have acted as a de facto staff counsel, notably with the
King investigation in England, as well as in the day-to-day dealings with
agencies and witnesses.

Consequently, based upon my work with the Committee and my unique
experience, I submit this request for a salary increase. Specifically,
I ask that my wages be raised from the present level of $18,000 per
year to $24,000 per year.

I look forward to my continued work with Dick and the other members
of the editorial staff. I find my duties gratifying, at times exhilarating,
and always challenging, and I do believe that I am uniquely qualified to
make a significant contribution to our final report.

Thank you for your kind consideration. I would greatly appreciate a
reply to this request.
